Abstract = {In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into
   logistics optimization has gained significant attention, particularly
   concerning sustainability criteria. This article provides an overview of
   the diverse AI models and algorithms employed in logistics optimization,
   with a focus on sustainable practices. The discussion covers several
   techniques, including generative models, machine learning methods,
   metaheuristic algorithms, and their synergistic combinations with
   traditional optimization and simulation methods. By employing AI
   capabilities, logistics stakeholders can enhance decision-making
   processes, optimize resource utilization, and minimize environmental
   impacts. Moreover, this paper identifies and analyzes prominent
   challenges within sustainable logistics, such as reducing carbon
   emissions, minimizing waste generation, and optimizing transportation
   routes while considering ecological factors. Furthermore, the paper
   explores emerging trends in AI-driven logistics optimization, such as
   the integration of real-time data analytics, blockchain technology, and
   autonomous systems, which hold immense potential for enhancing
   efficiency and sustainability. Finally, the paper outlines future
   research directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration of
   hybrid AI approaches, robust optimization frameworks, and scalable
   solutions that accommodate dynamic and uncertain logistics environments.},

Abstract = {Green logistics is the part of the activities of an enterprise aimed at
   measuring and minimizing the impact of logistics activities on the
   environment. Such actions are dictated by the possibility of achieving a
   competitive advantage in the market, because clients require it.
   Transport is a particularly important area with a huge impact on the
   environment, because it is identified as the fastest growing source of
   greenhouse gas emissions. Green transport is low-emission and ecological
   travelling mode. The goals of green transport are not only to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, noise and space use, but also
   to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Transport is considered
   green when it supports environmental sustainability, but also supports
   the other two pillars of sustainable development, i.e. economic and
   social. This paper discusses the application of the concept of
   ``green{''} logistics and ``green{''} technologies in transport in the
   transportation process. The modem requirements for transport in the
   field of environmental safety and compliance with environmental
   requirements both on the part of customers and on the part of states are
   considered.},

Title = {UAV Localization Method with Keypoints on the Edges of Semantic Objects
   for Low-Altitude Economy},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The low-altitude economy heavily relies on new carriers represented by
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The localization accuracy of UAVs
   highly relies on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which
   can be easily affected in low-altitude urban environments, making it
   difficult to maintain effective localization accuracy. To solve this
   problem, this paper proposes a UAV autonomous localization method with
   keypoints on the edges of semantic objects (KESO). Firstly, semantic
   objects within the working area are selected, and then the latitude,
   longitude, and altitude of these semantic objects' keypoints are
   measured to construct a database. By identifying the semantic objects
   from aerial images and detecting the edge of the semantic objects, the
   keypoints of the semantic objects are obtained. Finally, by matching the
   detected keypoints in the aerial images with the keypoints in the
   database, the UAV's position can achieve a high-precision position when
   satellite signals are blocked in low-altitude urban environments. As
   verified by real flight data, the results show that the localization
   error is less than 5 m, and the edges of objects can obtain more
   accurate keypoints to help UAVs locate more accurately. This paper can
   provide a reference for UAV localization in the urban environments of
   the low-altitude economy.},

Abstract = {The fast development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known
   as drones, has brought a unique set of opportunities and challenges to
   both the civilian and military sectors. While drones have proven useful
   in sectors such as delivery, agriculture, and surveillance, their
   potential for abuse in illegal airspace invasions, privacy breaches, and
   security risks has increased the demand for improved detection and
   classification systems. This state-of-the-art review presents a detailed
   overview of current improvements in drone detection and classification
   techniques: highlighting novel strategies used to address the rising
   concerns about UAV activities. We investigate the threats and challenges
   faced due to drones' dynamic behavior, size and speed diversity, battery
   life, etc. Furthermore, we categorize the key detection modalities,
   including radar, radio frequency (RF), acoustic, and vision-based
   approaches, and examine their distinct advantages and limitations. The
   research also discusses the importance of sensor fusion methods and
   other detection approaches, including wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi),
   cellular, and Internet of Things (IoT) networks, for improving the
   accuracy and efficiency of UAV detection and identification.},

Abstract = {In the modern world, zero-carbon society has become a new buzzword of
   the era. Many projects have been initiated to develop alternatives not
   only to the environmental crisis but also to the shortage of fossil
   fuels. With successful projects in automobile technology, hydrogen fuel
   is now being tested and utilized as a sustainable green fuel in the
   aviation sector which will lead to zero carbon emission in the future.
   From the mid-20th century to the early 21st numerous countries and
   companies have funded multimillion projects to develop hydrogen-fueled
   aircraft. Empirical data show positive results for various projects.
   Consequently, large companies are investing in various innovations
   undertaken by re-searchers under their supervision. Over time, the
   efficiency of hydrogen-fueled aircraft has improved but the lack of
   refueling stations, large production cost, and consolidated carbon
   market share have impeded the path of hydrogen fuel being
   commercialized. In addition, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is
   another important element of the Aviation industry, Hydrogen started to
   be commonly used as an alternative fuel for heavy-duty drones using fuel
   cell technology. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of
   the chrono-logical development of hydrogen-powered aircraft technology
   and potential aviation ap-plications for hydrogen and fuel cell
   technology. Furthermore, the major barriers to widespread adoption of
   hydrogen technology in aviation are identified, as are future research
   opportunities.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {The growing interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from both the
   scientific and industrial sectors has attracted a wave of new
   researchers and substantial investments in this expansive field.
   However, due to the wide range of topics and subdomains within UAV
   research, newcomers may find themselves overwhelmed by the numerous
   options available. It is therefore crucial for those involved in UAV
   research to recognize its interdisciplinary nature and its connections
   with other disciplines. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of
   the UAV field, highlighting recent trends and advancements. Drawing on
   recent literature reviews and surveys, the review begins by classifying
   UAVs based on their flight characteristics. It then provides an overview
   of current research trends in UAVs, utilizing data from the Scopus
   database to quantify the number of scientific documents associated with
   each research direction and their interconnections. This paper also
   explores potential areas for further development in UAVs, including
   communication, artificial intelligence, remote sensing, miniaturization,
   swarming and cooperative control, and transformability. Additionally, it
   discusses the development of aircraft control, commonly used control
   techniques, and appropriate control algorithms in UAV research.
   Furthermore, this paper addresses the general hardware and software
   architecture of UAVs, their applications, and the key issues associated
   with them. It also provides an overview of current open source software
   and hardware projects in the UAV field. By presenting a comprehensive
   view of the UAV field, this paper aims to enhance our understanding of
   this rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary area of research.},

   classification and review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The operational design and planning of drone-based logistics models is a
   rapidly growing area of scientific research. In this paper, we present a
   structured, comprehensive, and scalable framework for classifying
   drone-based delivery systems and their associated routing problems along
   with a comprehensive review and synthesis of the extant academic
   literature in this domain. While our proposed classification defines the
   boundaries and facilitates the comparison between a wide variety of
   possible drone-based logistics systems, our comprehensive literature
   review helps to identify and prioritize research gaps that need to be
   addressed by future work. Our review shows that the extant research
   reasonably considers some relevant real-world operational constraints.
   Although the multi-visit multi-drone Pure-play Drone-based (PD) delivery
   models are popular, the majority of the Synchronized Multi-modal (SM)
   delivery models focus on formulating and evaluating single-truck,
   single-drone models. Moreover, the Resupply Multi-modal (RM) models have
   not received the due attention for research compared to other
   drone-based delivery models. Our comprehensive review of use cases of
   drones for delivery indicates that most of the reviewed models are
   designed for applications in e-commerce and healthcare/ emergency
   services. Other applications, such as food and mail deliveries are still
   underrepresented in the academic discussion.},

Abstract = {Purpose-This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the
   interdisciplinary literature on drones in last-mile delivery (LMD) to
   extrapolate pertinent insights from and into the logistics management
   field.
   Design/methodology/approach-Rooting their analytical categories in the
   LMD literature, the authors performed a deductive, theory refinement SLR
   on 307 interdisciplinary journal articles published during 2015-2022 to
   integrate this emergent phenomenon into the field.
   Findings-The authors derived the potentials, challenges and solutions of
   drone deliveries in relation to 12 LMD criteria dispersed across four
   stakeholder groups: senders, receivers, regulators and societies.
   Relationships between these criteria were also identified.
   Research limitations/implications-This review contributes to logistics
   management by offering a current, nuanced and multifaceted discussion of
   drones' potential to improve the LMD process together with the
   challenges and solutions involved.
   Practical implications-The authors provide logistics managers with a
   holistic roadmap to help them make informed decisions about adopting
   drones in their delivery systems. Regulators and society members also
   gain insights into the prospects, requirements and repercussions of
   drone deliveries.
   Originality/value-This is one of the first SLRs on drone applications in
   LMD from a logistics management perspective.},

Title = {Applications and Research avenues for drone-based models in logistics: A
   classification and review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The operational design and planning of drone-based logistics models is a
   rapidly growing area of scientific research. In this paper, we present a
   structured, comprehensive, and scalable framework for classifying
   drone-based delivery systems and their associated routing problems along
   with a comprehensive review and synthesis of the extant academic
   literature in this domain. While our proposed classification defines the
   boundaries and facilitates the comparison between a wide variety of
   possible drone-based logistics systems, our comprehensive literature
   review helps to identify and prioritize research gaps that need to be
   addressed by future work. Our review shows that the extant research
   reasonably considers some relevant real-world operational constraints.
   Although the multi-visit multi-drone Pure-play Drone-based (PD) delivery
   models are popular, the majority of the Synchronized Multi-modal (SM)
   delivery models focus on formulating and evaluating single-truck,
   single-drone models. Moreover, the Resupply Multi-modal (RM) models have
   not received the due attention for research compared to other
   drone-based delivery models. Our comprehensive review of use cases of
   drones for delivery indicates that most of the reviewed models are
   designed for applications in e-commerce and healthcare/ emergency
   services. Other applications, such as food and mail deliveries are still
   underrepresented in the academic discussion.},

Abstract = {Purpose-This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the
   interdisciplinary literature on drones in last-mile delivery (LMD) to
   extrapolate pertinent insights from and into the logistics management
   field.
   Design/methodology/approach-Rooting their analytical categories in the
   LMD literature, the authors performed a deductive, theory refinement SLR
   on 307 interdisciplinary journal articles published during 2015-2022 to
   integrate this emergent phenomenon into the field.
   Findings-The authors derived the potentials, challenges and solutions of
   drone deliveries in relation to 12 LMD criteria dispersed across four
   stakeholder groups: senders, receivers, regulators and societies.
   Relationships between these criteria were also identified.
   Research limitations/implications-This review contributes to logistics
   management by offering a current, nuanced and multifaceted discussion of
   drones' potential to improve the LMD process together with the
   challenges and solutions involved.
   Practical implications-The authors provide logistics managers with a
   holistic roadmap to help them make informed decisions about adopting
   drones in their delivery systems. Regulators and society members also
   gain insights into the prospects, requirements and repercussions of
   drone deliveries.
   Originality/value-This is one of the first SLRs on drone applications in
   LMD from a logistics management perspective.},

Abstract = {Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have evolved into advanced
   instruments with diverse applications within the Logistics and Supply
   Chain (LSC) sector. Our study uncovers a significant disparity
   highlighted through an examination of recent review papers, indicating a
   deficiency in a thorough examination of the applications of drones/UAVs
   across the entirety of supply chains. Due to the abundance of
   publications in this field, a fresh analytical approach is required.
   Employing a novel text mining approach, qualitative assessments, and
   temporal trend analysis, we examine a dataset encompassing 5364 papers
   from Scopus spanning the years 1978 to 2023. By employing the Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we identify ten distinct research
   topics within the domain. Our findings suggest four promising future
   research directions: (1) fostering sustainable SCs through innovative
   drone-based solutions, (2) harnessing emerging technologies to achieve
   global scalability within drone-based SCs, (3) exploring the
   applications of drone-based supply chains in pandemic control efforts,
   and (4) integrating drone-based logistics with multimodal transportation
   for efficient traffic management. These directions provide valuable
   insights on the integration of drone-based transportation within
   existing and future supply chains, suggesting potential pathways for
   advancing production and logistics systems research.},

Abstract = {Drones have been pioneered and used in the military, however, only
   recently non-military drones have been introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic
   has brought into focus the potential value of drones in moving medical
   supplies. With the onset of social distancing policies and quarantine
   regulations, the efficiency of traditional logistics systems has been
   limited. Several companies have recently accelerated their development
   in this domain, conducting pilot projects at pace, paving the way for
   the future of the medical logistics supply chain. In this review, we
   examine both narrative and grey literature for in and out of hospital
   settings, in order to describe the current state of drone technology in
   healthcare around the world and some of the most cutting-edge examples
   of how drones can benefits patients, clinicians and the wider public. We
   investigate the economic viability and barriers to adopting drones at
   scale which include regulatory hurdles, public perception and safety of
   drone technologies, and propose how to overcome these challenges.
   Further work should look at quantifying the impact and outcomes of how
   such a service could impact the health outcomes of patients and clinical
   efficiency. This review aims to equip the National Health Service and
   more broadly other healthcare systems around the world with the tools to
   embrace and implement this novel and upcoming technology.},

Volume = {28},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {122-144},

Abstract = {Critical global challenges, such as climate change and the insufficient
   availability of resources, mean that it is a pivotal time to make cities
   more intelligent, efficient, and sustainable in a drive towards a
   net-zero carbon future. This requires intelligent, interactive, and
   responsive structural health monitoring (SHM) to assure the longevity
   and safety of ageing infrastructure. Drones have the potential to
   revolutionise SHM. Drone-based SHM (as a potential fly-by technique)
   involves equipping drones with various sensors, or using inbuilt
   sensors, to capture data and images of structures from different angles
   and perspectives. The data is then processed and analysed to facilitate
   accurate assessment of the structure's health and early diagnosis of
   damage. Although the use of fly-by is relatively new, the speedy
   advances in various technologies that could be integrated with it, such
   as computer vision with artificial intelligence, deep learning, and
   links to digital twins, put these systems on the verge of a potential
   breakthrough. This paper provides an overview of fly-by SHM technique
   using both scientometric and qualitative systematic literature review
   processes, in order to provide a distinct understanding of the state of
   the art of research. As an original contribution, our research
   identified four main clusters of research within the field of fly-by
   SHM: (1) the application of UAV-enabled vision-based monitoring; (2) the
   integration of drones, advanced sensor technologies, and artificial
   intelligence; (3) drone-based SHM integrating modal analysis, energy
   harvesting, and deep learning; and (4) automation and robotics in
   drone-based SHM. The paper highlights the integration of new
   technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
   sensors with the fly-by technique for SHM, identifies the gaps in
   current fly-by SHM research, and suggests new directions for research.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {198},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Drones, also called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), have witnessed a
   remarkable development in recent decades. In agriculture, they have
   changed farming practices by offering farmers substantial cost savings,
   increased operational efficiency, and better profitability. Over the
   past decades, the topic of agricultural drones has attracted remarkable
   academic attention. We therefore conduct a comprehensive review based on
   bibliometrics to summarize and structure existing academic literature
   and reveal current research trends and hotspots. We apply bibliometric
   techniques and analyze the literature surrounding agricultural drones to
   summarize and assess previous research. Our analysis indicates that
   remote sensing, precision agriculture, deep learning, machine learning,
   and the Internet of Things are critical topics related to agricultural
   drones. The co-citation analysis reveals six broad research clusters in
   the literature. This study is one of the first attempts to summarize
   drone research in agriculture and suggest future research directions.},

Title = {Drones for Flood Monitoring, Mapping and Detection: A Bibliometric
   Review},
Journal = {DRONES},

Abstract = {Floods are one of the most often occurring and damaging natural hazards.
   They impact the society on a massive scale and result in significant
   damages. To reduce the impact of floods, society needs to keep
   benefiting from the latest technological innovations. Drones equipped
   with sensors and latest algorithms (e.g., computer vision and deep
   learning) have emerged as a potential platform which may be useful for
   flood monitoring, mapping and detection activities in a more efficient
   way than current practice. To better understand the scope and recent
   trends in the domain of drones for flood management, we performed a
   detailed bibliometric analysis. The intent of performing the
   bibliometric analysis waws to highlight the important research trends,
   co-occurrence relationships and patterns to inform the new researchers
   in this domain. The bibliometric analysis was performed in terms of
   performance analysis (i.e., publication statistics, citations
   statistics, top publishing countries, top publishing journals, top
   publishing institutions, top publishers and top Web of Science (WoS)
   categories) and science mapping (i.e., citations by country, citations
   by journals, keyword co-occurrences, co-authorship, co-citations and
   bibliographic coupling) for a total of 569 records extracted from WoS
   for the duration 2000-2022. The VOSviewer open source tool has been used
   for generating the bibliographic network maps. Subjective discussions of
   the results explain the obtained trends from the bibliometric analysis.
   In the end, a detailed review of top 28 most recent publications was
   performed and subjected to process-driven analysis in the context of
   flood management. The potential active areas of research were also
   identified for future research in regard to the use of drones for flood
   monitoring, mapping and detection activities.},

Title = {Using Drones for Dendrometric Estimations in Forests: A Bibliometric
   Analysis},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Traditional field inventories have been the standard method for
   collecting detailed forest attribute data. However, these methods are
   often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, especially for large
   areas. In contrast, remote sensing technologies, such as unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs), have become viable alternatives for collecting forest
   structure data, providing high-resolution images, precision, and the
   ability to use various sensors. To explore this trend, a bibliometric
   review was conducted using the Scopus database to examine the evolution
   of scientific publications and assess the current state of research on
   using UAVs to estimate dendrometric variables in forest ecosystems. A
   total of 454 studies were identified, with 199 meeting the established
   inclusion criteria for further analysis. The findings indicated that
   China and the United States are the leading contributors to this
   research domain, with a notable increase in journal publications over
   the past five years. The predominant focus has been on planted forests,
   particularly utilizing RGB sensors attached to UAVs for variable
   estimation. The primary variables assessed using UAV technology include
   total tree height, DBH, above-ground biomass, and canopy area.
   Consequently, this review has highlighted the most influential studies
   in the field, establishing a foundation for future research directions.},

Abstract = {Nowadays organizations are under increasing pressure to adopt
   sustainable solutions for material handling and management due to
   growing environmental awareness. This drive has spurred advancements in
   innovative technologies, optimizing logistic processes to reduce energy
   usage and emissions, and enhancing overall supply chain sustainability.
   This approach extends to internal material handling with forklifts and
   the emerging use of drones for last-mile operations. Despite the
   importance of sustainable logistic practices, the literature lacks a
   comprehensive review of research on forklifts and drones in logistic
   activities. Through a Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA),
   this paper addresses this gap by conducting a comparative analysis of
   two bibliometric reviews: one on forklifts' sustainable logistic
   applications and the other on drones'. This analysis aims to identify
   key contributors, countries, journals, and research themes in both
   areas. The SLNA results seek to highlight existing literature,
   productive countries, influential authors, and research themes. This
   paper provides theoretical contributions by identifying gaps in the
   current literature and highlighting key research themes related to
   sustainable logistic practices. Furthermore, it offers practical
   insights to industry stakeholders on integrating these practices using
   forklifts and drones, while also laying the groundwork for future
   research through a comparative analysis. Copyright (C) 2024 The Authors.
