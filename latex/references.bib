Abstract = {In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into
   logistics optimization has gained significant attention, particularly
   concerning sustainability criteria. This article provides an overview of
   the diverse AI models and algorithms employed in logistics optimization,
   with a focus on sustainable practices. The discussion covers several
   techniques, including generative models, machine learning methods,
   metaheuristic algorithms, and their synergistic combinations with
   traditional optimization and simulation methods. By employing AI
   capabilities, logistics stakeholders can enhance decision-making
   processes, optimize resource utilization, and minimize environmental
   impacts. Moreover, this paper identifies and analyzes prominent
   challenges within sustainable logistics, such as reducing carbon
   emissions, minimizing waste generation, and optimizing transportation
   routes while considering ecological factors. Furthermore, the paper
   explores emerging trends in AI-driven logistics optimization, such as
   the integration of real-time data analytics, blockchain technology, and
   autonomous systems, which hold immense potential for enhancing
   efficiency and sustainability. Finally, the paper outlines future
   research directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration of
   hybrid AI approaches, robust optimization frameworks, and scalable
   solutions that accommodate dynamic and uncertain logistics environments.},

Abstract = {Green logistics is the part of the activities of an enterprise aimed at
   measuring and minimizing the impact of logistics activities on the
   environment. Such actions are dictated by the possibility of achieving a
   competitive advantage in the market, because clients require it.
   Transport is a particularly important area with a huge impact on the
   environment, because it is identified as the fastest growing source of
   greenhouse gas emissions. Green transport is low-emission and ecological
   travelling mode. The goals of green transport are not only to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, noise and space use, but also
   to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Transport is considered
   green when it supports environmental sustainability, but also supports
   the other two pillars of sustainable development, i.e. economic and
   social. This paper discusses the application of the concept of
   ``green{''} logistics and ``green{''} technologies in transport in the
   transportation process. The modem requirements for transport in the
   field of environmental safety and compliance with environmental
   requirements both on the part of customers and on the part of states are
   considered.},

Title = {UAV Localization Method with Keypoints on the Edges of Semantic Objects
   for Low-Altitude Economy},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The low-altitude economy heavily relies on new carriers represented by
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The localization accuracy of UAVs
   highly relies on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which
   can be easily affected in low-altitude urban environments, making it
   difficult to maintain effective localization accuracy. To solve this
   problem, this paper proposes a UAV autonomous localization method with
   keypoints on the edges of semantic objects (KESO). Firstly, semantic
   objects within the working area are selected, and then the latitude,
   longitude, and altitude of these semantic objects' keypoints are
   measured to construct a database. By identifying the semantic objects
   from aerial images and detecting the edge of the semantic objects, the
   keypoints of the semantic objects are obtained. Finally, by matching the
   detected keypoints in the aerial images with the keypoints in the
   database, the UAV's position can achieve a high-precision position when
   satellite signals are blocked in low-altitude urban environments. As
   verified by real flight data, the results show that the localization
   error is less than 5 m, and the edges of objects can obtain more
   accurate keypoints to help UAVs locate more accurately. This paper can
   provide a reference for UAV localization in the urban environments of
   the low-altitude economy.},

Abstract = {The fast development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known
   as drones, has brought a unique set of opportunities and challenges to
   both the civilian and military sectors. While drones have proven useful
   in sectors such as delivery, agriculture, and surveillance, their
   potential for abuse in illegal airspace invasions, privacy breaches, and
   security risks has increased the demand for improved detection and
   classification systems. This state-of-the-art review presents a detailed
   overview of current improvements in drone detection and classification
   techniques: highlighting novel strategies used to address the rising
   concerns about UAV activities. We investigate the threats and challenges
   faced due to drones' dynamic behavior, size and speed diversity, battery
   life, etc. Furthermore, we categorize the key detection modalities,
   including radar, radio frequency (RF), acoustic, and vision-based
   approaches, and examine their distinct advantages and limitations. The
   research also discusses the importance of sensor fusion methods and
   other detection approaches, including wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi),
   cellular, and Internet of Things (IoT) networks, for improving the
   accuracy and efficiency of UAV detection and identification.},

Abstract = {In the modern world, zero-carbon society has become a new buzzword of
   the era. Many projects have been initiated to develop alternatives not
   only to the environmental crisis but also to the shortage of fossil
   fuels. With successful projects in automobile technology, hydrogen fuel
   is now being tested and utilized as a sustainable green fuel in the
   aviation sector which will lead to zero carbon emission in the future.
   From the mid-20th century to the early 21st numerous countries and
   companies have funded multimillion projects to develop hydrogen-fueled
   aircraft. Empirical data show positive results for various projects.
   Consequently, large companies are investing in various innovations
   undertaken by re-searchers under their supervision. Over time, the
   efficiency of hydrogen-fueled aircraft has improved but the lack of
   refueling stations, large production cost, and consolidated carbon
   market share have impeded the path of hydrogen fuel being
   commercialized. In addition, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is
   another important element of the Aviation industry, Hydrogen started to
   be commonly used as an alternative fuel for heavy-duty drones using fuel
   cell technology. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of
   the chrono-logical development of hydrogen-powered aircraft technology
   and potential aviation ap-plications for hydrogen and fuel cell
   technology. Furthermore, the major barriers to widespread adoption of
   hydrogen technology in aviation are identified, as are future research
   opportunities.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {The growing interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from both the
   scientific and industrial sectors has attracted a wave of new
   researchers and substantial investments in this expansive field.
   However, due to the wide range of topics and subdomains within UAV
   research, newcomers may find themselves overwhelmed by the numerous
   options available. It is therefore crucial for those involved in UAV
   research to recognize its interdisciplinary nature and its connections
   with other disciplines. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of
   the UAV field, highlighting recent trends and advancements. Drawing on
   recent literature reviews and surveys, the review begins by classifying
   UAVs based on their flight characteristics. It then provides an overview
   of current research trends in UAVs, utilizing data from the Scopus
   database to quantify the number of scientific documents associated with
   each research direction and their interconnections. This paper also
   explores potential areas for further development in UAVs, including
   communication, artificial intelligence, remote sensing, miniaturization,
   swarming and cooperative control, and transformability. Additionally, it
   discusses the development of aircraft control, commonly used control
   techniques, and appropriate control algorithms in UAV research.
   Furthermore, this paper addresses the general hardware and software
   architecture of UAVs, their applications, and the key issues associated
   with them. It also provides an overview of current open source software
   and hardware projects in the UAV field. By presenting a comprehensive
   view of the UAV field, this paper aims to enhance our understanding of
   this rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary area of research.},

   classification and review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The operational design and planning of drone-based logistics models is a
   rapidly growing area of scientific research. In this paper, we present a
   structured, comprehensive, and scalable framework for classifying
   drone-based delivery systems and their associated routing problems along
   with a comprehensive review and synthesis of the extant academic
   literature in this domain. While our proposed classification defines the
   boundaries and facilitates the comparison between a wide variety of
   possible drone-based logistics systems, our comprehensive literature
   review helps to identify and prioritize research gaps that need to be
   addressed by future work. Our review shows that the extant research
   reasonably considers some relevant real-world operational constraints.
   Although the multi-visit multi-drone Pure-play Drone-based (PD) delivery
   models are popular, the majority of the Synchronized Multi-modal (SM)
   delivery models focus on formulating and evaluating single-truck,
   single-drone models. Moreover, the Resupply Multi-modal (RM) models have
   not received the due attention for research compared to other
   drone-based delivery models. Our comprehensive review of use cases of
   drones for delivery indicates that most of the reviewed models are
   designed for applications in e-commerce and healthcare/ emergency
   services. Other applications, such as food and mail deliveries are still
   underrepresented in the academic discussion.},

Abstract = {Purpose-This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the
   interdisciplinary literature on drones in last-mile delivery (LMD) to
   extrapolate pertinent insights from and into the logistics management
   field.
   Design/methodology/approach-Rooting their analytical categories in the
   LMD literature, the authors performed a deductive, theory refinement SLR
   on 307 interdisciplinary journal articles published during 2015-2022 to
   integrate this emergent phenomenon into the field.
   Findings-The authors derived the potentials, challenges and solutions of
   drone deliveries in relation to 12 LMD criteria dispersed across four
   stakeholder groups: senders, receivers, regulators and societies.
   Relationships between these criteria were also identified.
   Research limitations/implications-This review contributes to logistics
   management by offering a current, nuanced and multifaceted discussion of
   drones' potential to improve the LMD process together with the
   challenges and solutions involved.
   Practical implications-The authors provide logistics managers with a
   holistic roadmap to help them make informed decisions about adopting
   drones in their delivery systems. Regulators and society members also
   gain insights into the prospects, requirements and repercussions of
   drone deliveries.
   Originality/value-This is one of the first SLRs on drone applications in
   LMD from a logistics management perspective.},

Title = {Applications and Research avenues for drone-based models in logistics: A
   classification and review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The operational design and planning of drone-based logistics models is a
   rapidly growing area of scientific research. In this paper, we present a
   structured, comprehensive, and scalable framework for classifying
   drone-based delivery systems and their associated routing problems along
   with a comprehensive review and synthesis of the extant academic
   literature in this domain. While our proposed classification defines the
   boundaries and facilitates the comparison between a wide variety of
   possible drone-based logistics systems, our comprehensive literature
   review helps to identify and prioritize research gaps that need to be
   addressed by future work. Our review shows that the extant research
   reasonably considers some relevant real-world operational constraints.
   Although the multi-visit multi-drone Pure-play Drone-based (PD) delivery
   models are popular, the majority of the Synchronized Multi-modal (SM)
   delivery models focus on formulating and evaluating single-truck,
   single-drone models. Moreover, the Resupply Multi-modal (RM) models have
   not received the due attention for research compared to other
   drone-based delivery models. Our comprehensive review of use cases of
   drones for delivery indicates that most of the reviewed models are
   designed for applications in e-commerce and healthcare/ emergency
   services. Other applications, such as food and mail deliveries are still
   underrepresented in the academic discussion.},

Abstract = {Purpose-This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the
   interdisciplinary literature on drones in last-mile delivery (LMD) to
   extrapolate pertinent insights from and into the logistics management
   field.
   Design/methodology/approach-Rooting their analytical categories in the
   LMD literature, the authors performed a deductive, theory refinement SLR
   on 307 interdisciplinary journal articles published during 2015-2022 to
   integrate this emergent phenomenon into the field.
   Findings-The authors derived the potentials, challenges and solutions of
   drone deliveries in relation to 12 LMD criteria dispersed across four
   stakeholder groups: senders, receivers, regulators and societies.
   Relationships between these criteria were also identified.
   Research limitations/implications-This review contributes to logistics
   management by offering a current, nuanced and multifaceted discussion of
   drones' potential to improve the LMD process together with the
   challenges and solutions involved.
   Practical implications-The authors provide logistics managers with a
   holistic roadmap to help them make informed decisions about adopting
   drones in their delivery systems. Regulators and society members also
   gain insights into the prospects, requirements and repercussions of
   drone deliveries.
   Originality/value-This is one of the first SLRs on drone applications in
   LMD from a logistics management perspective.},

Abstract = {Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have evolved into advanced
   instruments with diverse applications within the Logistics and Supply
   Chain (LSC) sector. Our study uncovers a significant disparity
   highlighted through an examination of recent review papers, indicating a
   deficiency in a thorough examination of the applications of drones/UAVs
   across the entirety of supply chains. Due to the abundance of
   publications in this field, a fresh analytical approach is required.
   Employing a novel text mining approach, qualitative assessments, and
   temporal trend analysis, we examine a dataset encompassing 5364 papers
   from Scopus spanning the years 1978 to 2023. By employing the Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we identify ten distinct research
   topics within the domain. Our findings suggest four promising future
   research directions: (1) fostering sustainable SCs through innovative
   drone-based solutions, (2) harnessing emerging technologies to achieve
   global scalability within drone-based SCs, (3) exploring the
   applications of drone-based supply chains in pandemic control efforts,
   and (4) integrating drone-based logistics with multimodal transportation
   for efficient traffic management. These directions provide valuable
   insights on the integration of drone-based transportation within
   existing and future supply chains, suggesting potential pathways for
   advancing production and logistics systems research.},

Abstract = {Drones have been pioneered and used in the military, however, only
   recently non-military drones have been introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic
   has brought into focus the potential value of drones in moving medical
   supplies. With the onset of social distancing policies and quarantine
   regulations, the efficiency of traditional logistics systems has been
   limited. Several companies have recently accelerated their development
   in this domain, conducting pilot projects at pace, paving the way for
   the future of the medical logistics supply chain. In this review, we
   examine both narrative and grey literature for in and out of hospital
   settings, in order to describe the current state of drone technology in
   healthcare around the world and some of the most cutting-edge examples
   of how drones can benefits patients, clinicians and the wider public. We
   investigate the economic viability and barriers to adopting drones at
   scale which include regulatory hurdles, public perception and safety of
   drone technologies, and propose how to overcome these challenges.
   Further work should look at quantifying the impact and outcomes of how
   such a service could impact the health outcomes of patients and clinical
   efficiency. This review aims to equip the National Health Service and
   more broadly other healthcare systems around the world with the tools to
   embrace and implement this novel and upcoming technology.},

Volume = {28},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {122-144},

Abstract = {Critical global challenges, such as climate change and the insufficient
   availability of resources, mean that it is a pivotal time to make cities
   more intelligent, efficient, and sustainable in a drive towards a
   net-zero carbon future. This requires intelligent, interactive, and
   responsive structural health monitoring (SHM) to assure the longevity
   and safety of ageing infrastructure. Drones have the potential to
   revolutionise SHM. Drone-based SHM (as a potential fly-by technique)
   involves equipping drones with various sensors, or using inbuilt
   sensors, to capture data and images of structures from different angles
   and perspectives. The data is then processed and analysed to facilitate
   accurate assessment of the structure's health and early diagnosis of
   damage. Although the use of fly-by is relatively new, the speedy
   advances in various technologies that could be integrated with it, such
   as computer vision with artificial intelligence, deep learning, and
   links to digital twins, put these systems on the verge of a potential
   breakthrough. This paper provides an overview of fly-by SHM technique
   using both scientometric and qualitative systematic literature review
   processes, in order to provide a distinct understanding of the state of
   the art of research. As an original contribution, our research
   identified four main clusters of research within the field of fly-by
   SHM: (1) the application of UAV-enabled vision-based monitoring; (2) the
   integration of drones, advanced sensor technologies, and artificial
   intelligence; (3) drone-based SHM integrating modal analysis, energy
   harvesting, and deep learning; and (4) automation and robotics in
   drone-based SHM. The paper highlights the integration of new
   technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
   sensors with the fly-by technique for SHM, identifies the gaps in
   current fly-by SHM research, and suggests new directions for research.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {198},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Drones, also called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), have witnessed a
   remarkable development in recent decades. In agriculture, they have
   changed farming practices by offering farmers substantial cost savings,
   increased operational efficiency, and better profitability. Over the
   past decades, the topic of agricultural drones has attracted remarkable
   academic attention. We therefore conduct a comprehensive review based on
   bibliometrics to summarize and structure existing academic literature
   and reveal current research trends and hotspots. We apply bibliometric
   techniques and analyze the literature surrounding agricultural drones to
   summarize and assess previous research. Our analysis indicates that
   remote sensing, precision agriculture, deep learning, machine learning,
   and the Internet of Things are critical topics related to agricultural
   drones. The co-citation analysis reveals six broad research clusters in
   the literature. This study is one of the first attempts to summarize
   drone research in agriculture and suggest future research directions.},

Title = {Drones for Flood Monitoring, Mapping and Detection: A Bibliometric
   Review},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Floods are one of the most often occurring and damaging natural hazards.
   They impact the society on a massive scale and result in significant
   damages. To reduce the impact of floods, society needs to keep
   benefiting from the latest technological innovations. Drones equipped
   with sensors and latest algorithms (e.g., computer vision and deep
   learning) have emerged as a potential platform which may be useful for
   flood monitoring, mapping and detection activities in a more efficient
   way than current practice. To better understand the scope and recent
   trends in the domain of drones for flood management, we performed a
   detailed bibliometric analysis. The intent of performing the
   bibliometric analysis waws to highlight the important research trends,
   co-occurrence relationships and patterns to inform the new researchers
   in this domain. The bibliometric analysis was performed in terms of
   performance analysis (i.e., publication statistics, citations
   statistics, top publishing countries, top publishing journals, top
   publishing institutions, top publishers and top Web of Science (WoS)
   categories) and science mapping (i.e., citations by country, citations
   by journals, keyword co-occurrences, co-authorship, co-citations and
   bibliographic coupling) for a total of 569 records extracted from WoS
   for the duration 2000-2022. The VOSviewer open source tool has been used
   for generating the bibliographic network maps. Subjective discussions of
   the results explain the obtained trends from the bibliometric analysis.
   In the end, a detailed review of top 28 most recent publications was
   performed and subjected to process-driven analysis in the context of
   flood management. The potential active areas of research were also
   identified for future research in regard to the use of drones for flood
   monitoring, mapping and detection activities.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Traditional field inventories have been the standard method for
   collecting detailed forest attribute data. However, these methods are
   often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, especially for large
   areas. In contrast, remote sensing technologies, such as unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs), have become viable alternatives for collecting forest
   structure data, providing high-resolution images, precision, and the
   ability to use various sensors. To explore this trend, a bibliometric
   review was conducted using the Scopus database to examine the evolution
   of scientific publications and assess the current state of research on
   using UAVs to estimate dendrometric variables in forest ecosystems. A
   total of 454 studies were identified, with 199 meeting the established
   inclusion criteria for further analysis. The findings indicated that
   China and the United States are the leading contributors to this
   research domain, with a notable increase in journal publications over
   the past five years. The predominant focus has been on planted forests,
   particularly utilizing RGB sensors attached to UAVs for variable
   estimation. The primary variables assessed using UAV technology include
   total tree height, DBH, above-ground biomass, and canopy area.
   Consequently, this review has highlighted the most influential studies
   in the field, establishing a foundation for future research directions.},

Abstract = {Nowadays organizations are under increasing pressure to adopt
   sustainable solutions for material handling and management due to
   growing environmental awareness. This drive has spurred advancements in
   innovative technologies, optimizing logistic processes to reduce energy
   usage and emissions, and enhancing overall supply chain sustainability.
   This approach extends to internal material handling with forklifts and
   the emerging use of drones for last-mile operations. Despite the
   importance of sustainable logistic practices, the literature lacks a
   comprehensive review of research on forklifts and drones in logistic
   activities. Through a Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA),
   this paper addresses this gap by conducting a comparative analysis of
   two bibliometric reviews: one on forklifts' sustainable logistic
   applications and the other on drones'. This analysis aims to identify
   key contributors, countries, journals, and research themes in both
   areas. The SLNA results seek to highlight existing literature,
   productive countries, influential authors, and research themes. This
   paper provides theoretical contributions by identifying gaps in the
   current literature and highlighting key research themes related to
   sustainable logistic practices. Furthermore, it offers practical
   insights to industry stakeholders on integrating these practices using
   forklifts and drones, while also laying the groundwork for future
   research through a comparative analysis. Copyright (C) 2024 The Authors.

Abstract = {Drone food delivery services refer to services that use drones to
   deliver food to customers as the role of services becomes more important
   in the food service industry, because drone food delivery services are
   not affected by traffic, so they can deliver food quickly. However,
   there is still a lack of research about drone food delivery services.
   Thus, this study examined the importance and necessity of drone food
   delivery services using the concept of perceived innovativeness. In
   Korea, a total of 324 samples collected in order to test the proposed
   model including fifteen hypotheses. The data analysis results showed
   that perceived innovativeness has a positive influence on attitude
   toward using drone food delivery services and behavioral intentions
   including intentions to use and word-of-mouth intentions. In addition,
   the attitude played an important role in the formation of behavioral
   intentions. Lastly, this study found the important moderating role of
   gender and age.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the types of perceived risks
   involved with using drone food delivery services. Furthermore, this
   study investigates the relationship between perceived risk and image of
   drone food delivery services. Lastly, this study examines the effect of
   image of drone food delivery services on desire, intentions to use and
   willingness to pay more.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study collected data from 331
   respondents in Korea. Before the start of the survey, the respondents
   were given a video, which made it easier for them to understand drone
   food delivery services.
   Findings - The three types of perceived risks (i.e. time risk,
   performance risk and psychological risk) have a negative influence on
   image of drone food delivery services and, thus, aids in increasing
   desire, intentions to use and willingness to pay more.
   Originality/value - The concept of perceived risk was applied to the
   context of drone food delivery services in this study in combination
   with other understudied concepts, image, desire, intentions to use and
   willingness to pay more. This study is one of the first studies that
   applied those significant concepts to the context of drone food delivery
   services, even though there are a large number of papers in the
   technology field. Thus, the findings of this study will be important to
   foodservice companies when building successful drone food delivery
   services.},

Abstract = {Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now
   poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such
   application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for
   last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research
   efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable
   delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational
   challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper
   provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing
   and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new
   paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the
   classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario
   in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a
   traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed
   integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone
   problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution
   approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these
   problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile
   delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt
   of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced
   environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between
   using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance. (C) 2015

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the vehicle routing problem with drones
   (VRPD). A fleet of trucks equipped with drones delivers packages to
   customers. Drones can be dispatched from and picked up by the trucks at
   the depot or any of the customer locations. The objective is to minimize
   the maximum duration of the routes (i.e., the completion time). The VRPD
   is motivated by a number of highly influential companies such as Amazon,
   DHL, and Federal Express, actively involved in exploring the potential
   use of commercial drones for package delivery. After stating our
   simplifying assumptions, we pose a number of questions in order to study
   the maximum savings that can be obtained from using drones; we then
   derive a number of worst-case results. The worst-case results depend on
   the number of drones per truck and the speed of the drones relative to
   the speed of the truck.},

Abstract = {E-commerce and retail companies are seeking ways to cut delivery times
   and costs by exploring opportunities to use drones for making last mile
   delivery deliveries. This paper addresses the delivery concept of a
   truck-drone combination along with the idea of allowing autonomous
   drones to fly from delivery trucks, make deliveries, and fly to any
   available delivery truck nearby. We present a mixed integer programming
   (MIP) formulation that captures this scenario with the objective of
   minimizing the arrival time of both trucks and drones at the depot after
   completing the deliveries. A new algorithm based on insertion heuristics
   is also developed to solve large sized problems containing up to a
   hundred locations. Experiments are conducted to compare the MIP
   solutions with those obtained from different models with single truck,
   multiple truck and a single truck and drone system, as well as test the
   performance of the proposed algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate
   the potential operational gain when implementing the proposed drone
   delivery system compared to the conventional truck alone or single
   truck/drone delivery system.},

Abstract = {The truck-drone hybrid delivery system uses a truck as a station for
   drones in addition to its delivery function and is getting attention
   because the strengths of these individual vehicles can be selectively
   and synergistically exploited. In this study, we extended the previous
   vehicle routing models to the hybrid delivery systems by taking into
   account two important practical issues: the effect of parcel weight on
   drone energy consumption and restricted flying areas. The flight range
   of the drones is heavily susceptible to the loaded weight due to the
   limited battery life. Drones are also not allowed to fly over sensitive
   facilities regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or
   temporarily in certain areas due to weather-related conditions. We
   developed a mathematical model that incorporates these issues and
   propose a two-phase constructive and search heuristic algorithm to
   provide computational efficiency of the real-world cases problems. The
   result of the numerical study demonstrates the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Title = {Perceived risks from drone food delivery services before and after
   COVID-19},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1276-1296},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study was to explore if five subdimensions of
   perceived risk (financial, time, privacy, performance and psychological
   risks) negatively affects image. In addition, this study aims to
   investigate if image has a positive effect on intentions to use. Lastly,
   the purpose of this study was to examine the moderating effect of
   Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), before and after the outbreak, in
   the relationship between perceived risk and image.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data were collected from 331 people before the COVID-19 outbreak and 343
   people after the COVID-19 outbreak. To test hypotheses, this study used
   structural equation modeling.
   Findings
   Time, performance and psychological risks negatively affected image
   before the outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, performance risks and
   psychological risks had a negative influence on image only after the
   outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, there was demonstrated to be a
   positive relationship between image and intentions to use, both before
   and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, the outbreak of COVID-19
   positively moderates the relationship between performance risk and
   image.
   Practical implications
   The current study provides the following practical implications. First,
   industry practitioners need to develop a performance guarantee system
   which enhances the quality assurance of drone food delivery services
   (DFDS). Second, live streaming or creative activities would help to
   visualize DFDS in a way that stresses the stable operation of these
   services.
   Originality/value
   The importance of contactless services has been emphasized ever since
   the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there has been very
   little research on the future of contactless services after COVID-19.
   This study investigated the perceived risk from DFDS as a form of
   contactless service which has not been conducted before. The findings of
   this study will improve the understanding of the changes that have
   occurred in consumers' perception of risk from DFDS during the COVID-19
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {There could be no smart city without a reliable and efficient
   transportation system. This necessity makes the ITS a key component of
   any smart city concept. While legacy ITS technologies are deployed
   worldwide in smart cities, enabling the next generation of ITS relies on
   effective integration of connected and autonomous vehicles, the two
   technologies that are under wide field testing in many cities around the
   world. Even though these two emerging technologies are crucial in
   enabling fully automated transportation systems, there is still a
   significant need to automate other road and transportation components.
   To this end, due to their mobility, autonomous operation, and
   communication/processing capabilities, UAVs are envisaged in many ITS
   application domains. This article describes the possible ITS
   applications that can use UAVs, and highlights the potential and

Abstract = {Suppliers, partners, companies and dealers in supply chains do use,
   generate and share information with others. These associations lead to a
   multitude of challenges and opportunities within the supply chains. A
   Digital Supply Chain (DSC) is a smart, value-driven, efficient process
   to generate new forms of revenue and business value for organizations
   and to leverage new approaches with novel technological and analytical
   methods DSC is not about whether goods and services are digital or
   physical, it is about the way how supply chain processes are managed
   with a wide variety of innovative technologies, e.g. unmanned aerial
   vehicles, cloud computing, and internet of things, among others. Recent
   literature highlights the importance of DSC and many industrial
   researchers discuss its applications. This article reviews the
   stateof-the-art of existing DSC literature in detail from both academic
   and industrial points of view. It identifies key limitations and
   prospects in DSC, summarizes prior research and identifies knowledge
   gaps by providing advantages, weaknesses and limitations of individual
   methods The article also aims at providing a development framework as a
   roadmap for future research and practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Global economic and social life has been severely challenged since the
   World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 disease a
   pandemic. Travel, tourism and hospitality, in particular, has been
   massively impacted by the lockdowns used to maintain social distance to
   manage the disease. Robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot
   interactions have gained an increased presence to help manage the spread
   of COVID-19 in hospitals, airports, transportation systems, recreation
   and scenic areas, hotels, restaurants, and communities in general.
   Humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other intelligent
   robots are used in many different ways to reduce human contact and the
   potential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including delivering
   materials, disinfecting and sterilizing public spaces, detecting or
   measuring body temperature, providing safety or security, and comforting
   and entertaining patients. While controversial in the past due to
   concerns over job losses and data privacy, the adoption of robotics and
   artificial intelligence in travel and tourism will likely continue after
   the COVID-19 pandemic becomes less serious. Tourism scholars should
   seize this opportunity to develop robotic applications that enhance
   tourist experiences, the protection of natural and cultural resources,
   citizen participation in tourism development decision making, and the
   emergence of new `high-touch' employment opportunities for travel,
   tourism and hospitality workers.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the vehicle routing problem with drones
   (VRPD). A fleet of trucks equipped with drones delivers packages to
   customers. Drones can be dispatched from and picked up by the trucks at
   the depot or any of the customer locations. The objective is to minimize
   the maximum duration of the routes (i.e., the completion time). The VRPD
   is motivated by a number of highly influential companies such as Amazon,
   DHL, and Federal Express, actively involved in exploring the potential
   use of commercial drones for package delivery. After stating our
   simplifying assumptions, we pose a number of questions in order to study
   the maximum savings that can be obtained from using drones; we then
   derive a number of worst-case results. The worst-case results depend on
   the number of drones per truck and the speed of the drones relative to
   the speed of the truck.},

Abstract = {The use of automated, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to deliver
   commercial packages is poised to become a new industry, significantly
   shifting energy use in the freight sector. Here we find the current
   practical range of multi-copters to be about 4 km with current battery
   technology, requiring a new network of urban warehouses or waystations
   as support. We show that, although drones consume less energy per
   package-km than delivery trucks, the additional warehouse energy
   required and the longer distances traveled by drones per package greatly
   increase the life-cycle impacts. Still, in most cases examined, the
   impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based
   delivery. Results suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based
   delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the
   freight sector. To realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery,
   regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and
   limiting the size of drones.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is an extension of the
   classic capacitated vehicle routing problem, where not only trucks but
   drones are used to deliver parcels to customers. One distinctive feature
   of the VRPD is that a drone may travel with a truck, take off from its
   stop to serve customers, and land at a service hub to travel with
   another truck as long as the flying range and loading capacity
   limitations are satisfied. Routing trucks and drones in an integrated
   manner makes the problem much more challenging and different from
   classical vehicle routing literature. We propose a mixed integer
   programming model, and develop a branch-and-price algorithm. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on the instances randomly generated in a
   practical setting, and the results demonstrate the good computational
   performance of the proposed algorithm. We also conduct sensitivity
   analysis on a key factor that may affect the total cost of a solution.

Abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is attracting considerable
   interest in academic research, commercial, and military applications.
   Multi-UAV systems organized in an ad hoc fashion called a flying ad hoc
   network (FANET) can cooperatively and collaboratively accomplish complex
   missions more efficiently compared to single large UAV systems. However,
   the unique features of FANETs such as high mobility, low node density,
   and high frequency of topology changes introduce challenges to the
   communication design, especially routing. Thus, the routing requirements
   of FANETs surpass those of MANETs or VANETs. In this paper, we present
   UAV classification, communication and application architectures, and an
   exhaustive survey of the existing routing protocols for flying ad hoc
   networks. Furthermore, we highlight the key features, strengths and
   weaknesses, and different mobility models used for the performance
   evaluation of the existing FANET routing protocols. More importantly, a
   proposed taxonomy and a review on the existing FANET routing protocols
   are presented. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges and open
   research issues.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, drone routing and scheduling has become a highly active
   area of research. This research introduces a new routing model that
   considers a synchronized truck-drone operation by allowing multiple
   drones to fly from a truck, serve one or multiple customers, and return
   to the same truck for a battery swap and package retrieval. The model
   addresses two levels (echelons) of delivery: primary truck routing from
   the main depot to serve assigned customers and secondary drone routing
   from the truck, which behaves like a moveable intermediate depot to
   serve other sets of customers. The model takes into account both trucks'
   and drones' capacities with the objective of finding optimal mutes of
   both trucks and drones that minimizes the total arrival time of both
   trucks and drones at the depot after completing the deliveries. The
   problem can be solved by formulated mixed integer programming (MIP) for
   the small-size problem, and two efficient heuristic algorithms are
   designed to solve the large-size problems: Drone Truck Route
   Construction (DTRC) and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS). Numeric results
   from the experiment compare the performance of both heuristics against
   the MIP method in small/medium-size instances from the literature. A
   sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the delivery time improvement
   of the proposed model over the previous truck-drone routing models.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is inspired by the
   increasing interest in commercial drone delivery by companies such as
   Amazon, Google, DHL, and Walmart. In our model, a fleet of m homogeneous
   trucks each carries k drones with a speed of times that of the truck.
   Each drone may dispatch from the top of the truck and carry a package to
   a customer location. The drone then returns to the top of its truck to
   recharge or swap batteries (we assume instantaneously). The truck itself
   is allowed to move and deliver packages, but must be stationary at a
   delivery location or the depot when launching or retrieving drones. The
   goal is to minimize the completion time to deliver all packages and
   return all vehicles back to the central depot. In this article, we
   review and extend several worst-case results from an earlier paper and
   we make connections with another practical variant of the vehicle
   routing problem and with Amdahl's Law. We find that the VRPD model
   offers some important practical advantages. The drones allow the truck
   to parallelize tasks and they are able to take advantage of crow-fly
   distances. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 70(1), 34-43

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have the potential to significantly
   reduce the cost and time of making last-mile deliveries and responding
   to emergencies. Despite this potential, little work has gone into
   developing vehicle routing problems (VRPs) specifically for drone
   delivery scenarios. Existing VRPs are insufficient for planning drone
   deliveries: either multiple trips to the depot are not permitted,
   leading to solutions with excess drones, or the effect of battery and
   payload weight on energy consumption is not considered, leading to
   costly or infeasible routes. We propose two multitrip VRPs for drone
   delivery that address both issues. One minimizes costs subject to a
   delivery time limit, while the other minimizes the overall delivery time
   subject to a budget constraint. We mathematically derive and
   experimentally validate an energy consumption model for multirotor
   drones, demonstrating that energy consumption varies approximately
   linearly with payload and battery weight. We use this approximation to
   derive mixed integer linear programs for our VRPs. We propose a cost
   function that considers our energy consumption model and drone reuse,
   and apply it in a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for finding
   suboptimal solutions to practical scenarios. To assist drone delivery
   practitioners with balancing cost and delivery time, the SA heuristic is
   used to show that the minimum cost has an inverse exponential
   relationship with the delivery time limit, and the minimum overall
   delivery time has an inverse exponential relationship with the budget.
   Numerical results confirm the importance of reusing drones and
   optimizing battery size in drone delivery VRPs.},

Abstract = {This paper considers a last-mile delivery system in which a delivery
   truck operates in coordination with a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs, or drones). Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers
   located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The
   problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP).
   However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only
   trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a
   heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three
   subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that
   this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within
   reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time
   savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also
   reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An
   analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of
   these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support
   anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and
   retrieval.},

Abstract = {Companies are adopting innovative methods for responsiveness and
   efficiency in the logistics sector. The implementation of drones in
   logistics sector is a move in this direction. Potential obstacles in the
   smooth adoption of drones in the logistics sector must be thoroughly
   analysed. The present study identifies and prioritises the barriers of
   drone logistics implementation based on their criticality by using the
   fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP).
   Initially, 34 barriers are identified through expert opinion and
   extensive literature review. Furthermore, relevant barriers are
   finalised among all the barriers by using the FDM. Finally,
   prioritisation of the barriers based on their criticality is done by AHP
   technique. The study concludes thatregulationsandthreat to privacy \&
   securityare the most critical barriers to implement drones in logistics
   sector.Public perception \& psychological,environmental,technical
   issues, andeconomic aspectsare the other identified critical barriers.
   The managerial implications of the findings that could help
   practitioners and policymakers in the effective implementation of drones
   in the logistics sector are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The paper considers a cloud-based Content Delivery Network (CDN) with
   Device-to-Device (D2D) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enabled
   caching. The network is managed by the operator that offers content
   transfer services to the set of Content Providers (CPs). A subscriber of
   any CP can receive its content either by first, cellular content
   transfer via a terrestrial Base Station (BS) or a UAV, or by second, D2D
   content transfer from another subscriber of this CP. Each CP aims to
   maximize its expected payoff defined as a reciprocal of the weighted sum
   of the expected content transfer cost and delay for its subscribers. The
   operators objective is to maximize its long-term average revenue and
   stabilize the queuing system which represents the content transfer
   services. To model the interactions between the operator and the CPs, a
   novel framework is proposed that combines: first, cooperative game that
   enables the CPs to form coalitions in which all subscribers can exchange
   content via D2D links, thereby reducing content transfer costs and
   delays; second, Lyapunov optimization based dynamic channel and UAVs
   activity allocation policy of the operator. Through analytical and
   numerical evaluations, it is proven that if the operator and each CP are
   rational, the network reaches a state where all the CPs are in the
   stable coalitional structure, whereas, the dynamic policy of the
   operator is optimal with the trade-off in the total queue backlog.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed efficiently to provide
   high quality of service for Internet of Things (IoT). By using
   cooperative communication and relay technologies, a large swarm of UAVs
   can enlarge the effective coverage area of IoT services via multiple
   relay nodes. However, the low latency service requirement and the
   dynamic topology of UAV network bring in new challenges for the
   effective routing optimization among UAVs. In this paper, a layered UAV
   swarm network architecture is proposed and an optimal number of UAVs is
   analyzed. Furthermore, a low latency routing algorithm (LLRA) is
   designed based on the partial location information and the connectivity
   of the network architecture. Finally, the performance of the proposed
   LLRA is verified by numerical results, which can decrease the link
   average delay and improve the packet delivery ratio in contrast to
   traditional routing algorithms without layered architecture.},
