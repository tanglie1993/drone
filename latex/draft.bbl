      \field{abstract}{The fast and cost-efficient home delivery of goods ordered online is logistically challenging. Many companies are looking for new ways to cross the last mile to their customers. One technology-enabled opportunity that recently has received much attention is the use of drones to support deliveries. An innovative last-mile delivery concept in which a truck collaborates with a drone to make deliveries gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) that we call the TSP with drone. In this paper, we model this problem as an integer program and develop several fast route-first, cluster-second heuristics based on local search and dynamic programming. We prove worst-case approximation ratios for the heuristics and test their performance by comparing the solutions to the optimal solutions for small instances. In addition, we apply our heuristics to several artificial instances with different characteristics and sizes. Our experiments show that substantial savings are possible with this concept compared to truck-only delivery.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have gained increasing interest in both academia and industries. The evolution of UAV technologies, such as artificial intelligence, component miniaturization, and computer vision, has decreased their cost and increased availability for diverse applications and services. Remarkably, the integration of computer vision with UAVs provides cutting-edge technology for visual navigation, localization, and obstacle avoidance, making them capable of autonomous operations. However, their limited capacity for autonomous navigation makes them unsuitable for global positioning system (GPS)-blind environments. Recently, vision-based approaches that use cheaper and more flexible visual sensors have shown considerable advantages in UAV navigation owing to the rapid development of computer vision. Visual localization and mapping, obstacle avoidance, and path planning are essential components of visual navigation. The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of vision-based UAV navigation techniques. Existing techniques have been categorized and extensively reviewed with regard to their capabilities and characteristics. Then, they are qualitatively compared in terms of various aspects. We have also discussed open issues and research challenges in the design and implementation of vision-based navigation techniques for UAVs.}

      \field{abstract}{Suppliers, partners, companies and dealers in supply chains do use, generate and share information with others. These associations lead to a multitude of challenges and opportunities within the supply chains. A Digital Supply Chain (DSC) is a smart, value-driven, efficient process to generate new forms of revenue and business value for organizations and to leverage new approaches with novel technological and analytical methods DSC is not about whether goods and services are digital or physical, it is about the way how supply chain processes are managed with a wide variety of innovative technologies, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles, cloud computing, and internet of things, among others. Recent literature highlights the importance of DSC and many industrial researchers discuss its applications. This article reviews the stateof-the-art of existing DSC literature in detail from both academic and industrial points of view. It identifies key limitations and prospects in DSC, summarizes prior research and identifies knowledge gaps by providing advantages, weaknesses and limitations of individual methods The article also aims at providing a development framework as a roadmap for future research and practice.

      \field{abstract}{In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into logistics optimization has gained significant attention, particularly concerning sustainability criteria. This article provides an overview of the diverse AI models and algorithms employed in logistics optimization, with a focus on sustainable practices. The discussion covers several techniques, including generative models, machine learning methods, metaheuristic algorithms, and their synergistic combinations with traditional optimization and simulation methods. By employing AI capabilities, logistics stakeholders can enhance decision-making processes, optimize resource utilization, and minimize environmental impacts. Moreover, this paper identifies and analyzes prominent challenges within sustainable logistics, such as reducing carbon emissions, minimizing waste generation, and optimizing transportation routes while considering ecological factors. Furthermore, the paper explores emerging trends in AI-driven logistics optimization, such as the integration of real-time data analytics, blockchain technology, and autonomous systems, which hold immense potential for enhancing efficiency and sustainability. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration of hybrid AI approaches, robust optimization frameworks, and scalable solutions that accommodate dynamic and uncertain logistics environments.}

      \field{abstract}{Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore if five subdimensions of perceived risk (financial, time, privacy, performance and psychological risks) negatively affects image. In addition, this study aims to investigate if image has a positive effect on intentions to use. Lastly, the purpose of this study was to examine the moderating effect of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), before and after the outbreak, in the relationship between perceived risk and image. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 331 people before the COVID-19 outbreak and 343 people after the COVID-19 outbreak. To test hypotheses, this study used structural equation modeling. Findings Time, performance and psychological risks negatively affected image before the outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, performance risks and psychological risks had a negative influence on image only after the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, there was demonstrated to be a positive relationship between image and intentions to use, both before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, the outbreak of COVID-19 positively moderates the relationship between performance risk and image. Practical implications The current study provides the following practical implications. First, industry practitioners need to develop a performance guarantee system which enhances the quality assurance of drone food delivery services (DFDS). Second, live streaming or creative activities would help to visualize DFDS in a way that stresses the stable operation of these services. Originality/value The importance of contactless services has been emphasized ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there has been very little research on the future of contactless services after COVID-19. This study investigated the perceived risk from DFDS as a form of contactless service which has not been conducted before. The findings of this study will improve the understanding of the changes that have occurred in consumers' perception of risk from DFDS during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

      \field{abstract}{Critical global challenges, such as climate change and the insufficient availability of resources, mean that it is a pivotal time to make cities more intelligent, efficient, and sustainable in a drive towards a net-zero carbon future. This requires intelligent, interactive, and responsive structural health monitoring (SHM) to assure the longevity and safety of ageing infrastructure. Drones have the potential to revolutionise SHM. Drone-based SHM (as a potential fly-by technique) involves equipping drones with various sensors, or using inbuilt sensors, to capture data and images of structures from different angles and perspectives. The data is then processed and analysed to facilitate accurate assessment of the structure's health and early diagnosis of damage. Although the use of fly-by is relatively new, the speedy advances in various technologies that could be integrated with it, such as computer vision with artificial intelligence, deep learning, and links to digital twins, put these systems on the verge of a potential breakthrough. This paper provides an overview of fly-by SHM technique using both scientometric and qualitative systematic literature review processes, in order to provide a distinct understanding of the state of the art of research. As an original contribution, our research identified four main clusters of research within the field of fly-by SHM: (1) the application of UAV-enabled vision-based monitoring; (2) the integration of drones, advanced sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence; (3) drone-based SHM integrating modal analysis, energy harvesting, and deep learning; and (4) automation and robotics in drone-based SHM. The paper highlights the integration of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensors with the fly-by technique for SHM, identifies the gaps in current fly-by SHM research, and suggests new directions for research.}

      \field{abstract}{Nowadays organizations are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable solutions for material handling and management due to growing environmental awareness. This drive has spurred advancements in innovative technologies, optimizing logistic processes to reduce energy usage and emissions, and enhancing overall supply chain sustainability. This approach extends to internal material handling with forklifts and the emerging use of drones for last-mile operations. Despite the importance of sustainable logistic practices, the literature lacks a comprehensive review of research on forklifts and drones in logistic activities. Through a Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA), this paper addresses this gap by conducting a comparative analysis of two bibliometric reviews: one on forklifts' sustainable logistic applications and the other on drones'. This analysis aims to identify key contributors, countries, journals, and research themes in both areas. The SLNA results seek to highlight existing literature, productive countries, influential authors, and research themes. This paper provides theoretical contributions by identifying gaps in the current literature and highlighting key research themes related to sustainable logistic practices. Furthermore, it offers practical insights to industry stakeholders on integrating these practices using forklifts and drones, while also laying the groundwork for future research through a comparative analysis.

      \field{abstract}{Purpose - This paper aims to explore the types of perceived risks involved with using drone food delivery services. Furthermore, this study investigates the relationship between perceived risk and image of drone food delivery services. Lastly, this study examines the effect of image of drone food delivery services on desire, intentions to use and willingness to pay more. Design/methodology/approach - This study collected data from 331 respondents in Korea. Before the start of the survey, the respondents were given a video, which made it easier for them to understand drone food delivery services. Findings - The three types of perceived risks (i.e. time risk, performance risk and psychological risk) have a negative influence on image of drone food delivery services and, thus, aids in increasing desire, intentions to use and willingness to pay more. Originality/value - The concept of perceived risk was applied to the context of drone food delivery services in this study in combination with other understudied concepts, image, desire, intentions to use and willingness to pay more. This study is one of the first studies that applied those significant concepts to the context of drone food delivery services, even though there are a large number of papers in the technology field. Thus, the findings of this study will be important to foodservice companies when building successful drone food delivery services.}

      \field{abstract}{Drone food delivery services refer to services that use drones to deliver food to customers as the role of services becomes more important in the food service industry, because drone food delivery services are not affected by traffic, so they can deliver food quickly. However, there is still a lack of research about drone food delivery services. Thus, this study examined the importance and necessity of drone food delivery services using the concept of perceived innovativeness. In Korea, a total of 324 samples collected in order to test the proposed model including fifteen hypotheses. The data analysis results showed that perceived innovativeness has a positive influence on attitude toward using drone food delivery services and behavioral intentions including intentions to use and word-of-mouth intentions. In addition, the attitude played an important role in the formation of behavioral intentions. Lastly, this study found the important moderating role of gender and age.}

      \field{abstract}{Floods are one of the most often occurring and damaging natural hazards. They impact the society on a massive scale and result in significant damages. To reduce the impact of floods, society needs to keep benefiting from the latest technological innovations. Drones equipped with sensors and latest algorithms (e.g., computer vision and deep learning) have emerged as a potential platform which may be useful for flood monitoring, mapping and detection activities in a more efficient way than current practice. To better understand the scope and recent trends in the domain of drones for flood management, we performed a detailed bibliometric analysis. The intent of performing the bibliometric analysis waws to highlight the important research trends, co-occurrence relationships and patterns to inform the new researchers in this domain. The bibliometric analysis was performed in terms of performance analysis (i.e., publication statistics, citations statistics, top publishing countries, top publishing journals, top publishing institutions, top publishers and top Web of Science (WoS) categories) and science mapping (i.e., citations by country, citations by journals, keyword co-occurrences, co-authorship, co-citations and bibliographic coupling) for a total of 569 records extracted from WoS for the duration 2000-2022. The VOSviewer open source tool has been used for generating the bibliographic network maps. Subjective discussions of the results explain the obtained trends from the bibliometric analysis. In the end, a detailed review of top 28 most recent publications was performed and subjected to process-driven analysis in the context of flood management. The potential active areas of research were also identified for future research in regard to the use of drones for flood monitoring, mapping and detection activities.}

      \field{abstract}{Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have evolved into advanced instruments with diverse applications within the Logistics and Supply Chain (LSC) sector. Our study uncovers a significant disparity highlighted through an examination of recent review papers, indicating a deficiency in a thorough examination of the applications of drones/UAVs across the entirety of supply chains. Due to the abundance of publications in this field, a fresh analytical approach is required. Employing a novel text mining approach, qualitative assessments, and temporal trend analysis, we examine a dataset encompassing 5364 papers from Scopus spanning the years 1978 to 2023. By employing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we identify ten distinct research topics within the domain. Our findings suggest four promising future research directions: (1) fostering sustainable SCs through innovative drone-based solutions, (2) harnessing emerging technologies to achieve global scalability within drone-based SCs, (3) exploring the applications of drone-based supply chains in pandemic control efforts, and (4) integrating drone-based logistics with multimodal transportation for efficient traffic management. These directions provide valuable insights on the integration of drone-based transportation within existing and future supply chains, suggesting potential pathways for advancing production and logistics systems research.}

      \field{abstract}{Purpose-This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the interdisciplinary literature on drones in last-mile delivery (LMD) to extrapolate pertinent insights from and into the logistics management field. Design/methodology/approach-Rooting their analytical categories in the LMD literature, the authors performed a deductive, theory refinement SLR on 307 interdisciplinary journal articles published during 2015-2022 to integrate this emergent phenomenon into the field. Findings-The authors derived the potentials, challenges and solutions of drone deliveries in relation to 12 LMD criteria dispersed across four stakeholder groups: senders, receivers, regulators and societies. Relationships between these criteria were also identified. Research limitations/implications-This review contributes to logistics management by offering a current, nuanced and multifaceted discussion of drones' potential to improve the LMD process together with the challenges and solutions involved. Practical implications-The authors provide logistics managers with a holistic roadmap to help them make informed decisions about adopting drones in their delivery systems. Regulators and society members also gain insights into the prospects, requirements and repercussions of drone deliveries. Originality/value-This is one of the first SLRs on drone applications in LMD from a logistics management perspective.}

      \field{abstract}{The truck-drone hybrid delivery system uses a truck as a station for drones in addition to its delivery function and is getting attention because the strengths of these individual vehicles can be selectively and synergistically exploited. In this study, we extended the previous vehicle routing models to the hybrid delivery systems by taking into account two important practical issues: the effect of parcel weight on drone energy consumption and restricted flying areas. The flight range of the drones is heavily susceptible to the loaded weight due to the limited battery life. Drones are also not allowed to fly over sensitive facilities regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or temporarily in certain areas due to weather-related conditions. We developed a mathematical model that incorporates these issues and propose a two-phase constructive and search heuristic algorithm to provide computational efficiency of the real-world cases problems. The result of the numerical study demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.}

      \field{abstract}{This study attempted to merge two theories, which included the norm activation model (NAM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), in order to explain eco-friendly behavioral intention formation in the context of drone food delivery services. In addition, this study deepened the theoretical framework by considering the moderating role of product knowledge about the pro-environmental role of the drone-based food delivery services. Sixteen hypotheses were tested using a total of 401 samples collected in Korea. The data analysis results indicated that all hypotheses within the model that merged the NAM and the TPB were statistically supported. Furthermore, product knowledge played a moderating role in the relationship between (1) ascribed responsibility and personal norm, (2) attitudes and behavioral intentions, and (3) subjective norm and personal norm.}

A conceptual model including eight hypotheses was developed and tested based on the data of two consumer samples, one collected before and the other after the outbreak of COVID-19. The data analysis results showed that perceived innovativeness positively affects attitude. In addition, the attitude, the subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control have a positive influence on behavioral intentions. Lastly, the outbreak of COVID-19 played a moderating role in the relationship between the attitude and behavioral intentions.}

      \field{abstract}{This study explores the evolving trends and research issues in the field of drone-assisted multimodal logistics over the past two decades. By employing various text-mining techniques on related research publications, we identify the most frequently investigated topics and research issues within this domain. Specifically, we utilize titles, abstracts, and keywords from the collected studies to perform both Latent Dirichlet Allocation techniques and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency analysis, which help in identifying latent topics and the core research themes within the field. Our analysis focuses on three primary categories of drone-assisted logistics: drone-truck, drone-ship, and drone-robot systems. The study aims to uncover which latent topics have been predominantly emphasized in each category and to highlight the distinct differences in research focuses among them. Our findings reveal specific trends and gaps in the existing literature, providing a clear roadmap for future research directions in drone-assisted multimodal logistics. This targeted analysis not only enhances our understanding of the current state of the field but also identifies critical areas that require further investigation to advance the application of drones in logistics.}

It takes as its focus VOSviewer, a freely available software package used to construct and display bibliometric relationships between a variety of variables. Beginning with published examples, the paper proceeds to create an original case study using bibliometrics to explore the extent to which the field of remote sensing is contributing to the implementation of sustainable development goals. This example uses Scopus data and VOSviewer to examine and contrast co-occurrence data among publications in six journals, and it demonstrates how such software can be successfully used to undertake preliminary studies and to shape subsequent research which employs more formal approaches.}

      \field{abstract}{E-commerce and retail companies are seeking ways to cut delivery times and costs by exploring opportunities to use drones for making last mile delivery deliveries. This paper addresses the delivery concept of a truck-drone combination along with the idea of allowing autonomous drones to fly from delivery trucks, make deliveries, and fly to any available delivery truck nearby. We present a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation that captures this scenario with the objective of minimizing the arrival time of both trucks and drones at the depot after completing the deliveries. A new algorithm based on insertion heuristics is also developed to solve large sized problems containing up to a hundred locations. Experiments are conducted to compare the MIP solutions with those obtained from different models with single truck, multiple truck and a single truck and drone system, as well as test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate the potential operational gain when implementing the proposed drone delivery system compared to the conventional truck alone or single truck/drone delivery system.}

      \field{abstract}{Green logistics is the part of the activities of an enterprise aimed at measuring and minimizing the impact of logistics activities on the environment. Such actions are dictated by the possibility of achieving a competitive advantage in the market, because clients require it. Transport is a particularly important area with a huge impact on the environment, because it is identified as the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions. Green transport is low-emission and ecological travelling mode. The goals of green transport are not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, noise and space use, but also to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Transport is considered green when it supports environmental sustainability, but also supports the other two pillars of sustainable development, i.e. economic and social. This paper discusses the application of the concept of ``green{''} logistics and ``green{''} technologies in transport in the transportation process. The modem requirements for transport in the field of environmental safety and compliance with environmental requirements both on the part of customers and on the part of states are considered.}

      \field{abstract}{Drones have been pioneered and used in the military, however, only recently non-military drones have been introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus the potential value of drones in moving medical supplies. With the onset of social distancing policies and quarantine regulations, the efficiency of traditional logistics systems has been limited. Several companies have recently accelerated their development in this domain, conducting pilot projects at pace, paving the way for the future of the medical logistics supply chain. In this review, we examine both narrative and grey literature for in and out of hospital settings, in order to describe the current state of drone technology in healthcare around the world and some of the most cutting-edge examples of how drones can benefits patients, clinicians and the wider public. We investigate the economic viability and barriers to adopting drones at scale which include regulatory hurdles, public perception and safety of drone technologies, and propose how to overcome these challenges. Further work should look at quantifying the impact and outcomes of how such a service could impact the health outcomes of patients and clinical efficiency. This review aims to equip the National Health Service and more broadly other healthcare systems around the world with the tools to embrace and implement this novel and upcoming technology.}

      \field{abstract}{The low-altitude economy heavily relies on new carriers represented by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The localization accuracy of UAVs highly relies on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which can be easily affected in low-altitude urban environments, making it difficult to maintain effective localization accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a UAV autonomous localization method with keypoints on the edges of semantic objects (KESO). Firstly, semantic objects within the working area are selected, and then the latitude, longitude, and altitude of these semantic objects' keypoints are measured to construct a database. By identifying the semantic objects from aerial images and detecting the edge of the semantic objects, the keypoints of the semantic objects are obtained. Finally, by matching the detected keypoints in the aerial images with the keypoints in the database, the UAV's position can achieve a high-precision position when satellite signals are blocked in low-altitude urban environments. As verified by real flight data, the results show that the localization error is less than 5 m, and the edges of objects can obtain more accurate keypoints to help UAVs locate more accurately. This paper can provide a reference for UAV localization in the urban environments of the low-altitude economy.}

      \field{abstract}{There could be no smart city without a reliable and efficient transportation system. This necessity makes the ITS a key component of any smart city concept. While legacy ITS technologies are deployed worldwide in smart cities, enabling the next generation of ITS relies on effective integration of connected and autonomous vehicles, the two technologies that are under wide field testing in many cities around the world. Even though these two emerging technologies are crucial in enabling fully automated transportation systems, there is still a significant need to automate other road and transportation components. To this end, due to their mobility, autonomous operation, and communication/processing capabilities, UAVs are envisaged in many ITS application domains. This article describes the possible ITS applications that can use UAVs, and highlights the potential and challenges for UAV-enabled ITS for next-generation smart cities.}

      \field{abstract}{The operational design and planning of drone-based logistics models is a rapidly growing area of scientific research. In this paper, we present a structured, comprehensive, and scalable framework for classifying drone-based delivery systems and their associated routing problems along with a comprehensive review and synthesis of the extant academic literature in this domain. While our proposed classification defines the boundaries and facilitates the comparison between a wide variety of possible drone-based logistics systems, our comprehensive literature review helps to identify and prioritize research gaps that need to be addressed by future work. Our review shows that the extant research reasonably considers some relevant real-world operational constraints. Although the multi-visit multi-drone Pure-play Drone-based (PD) delivery models are popular, the majority of the Synchronized Multi-modal (SM) delivery models focus on formulating and evaluating single-truck, single-drone models. Moreover, the Resupply Multi-modal (RM) models have not received the due attention for research compared to other drone-based delivery models. Our comprehensive review of use cases of drones for delivery indicates that most of the reviewed models are designed for applications in e-commerce and healthcare/ emergency services. Other applications, such as food and mail deliveries are still underrepresented in the academic discussion.}

      \field{abstract}{Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{The Traveling Salesman Problem with a Drone (TSP-D) is a hybrid truck and drone model of delivery, in which the drone rides on the truck and launches from the truck to deliver packages. Our approach to the TSP-D uses branch and bound, whereby each node of the branch-and-bound tree corresponds with a potential order to deliver a subset of packages. An approximate lower bound at each node is given by solving a dynamic program. We provide additional variants of our heuristic approach and compare solution quality and computation times. Consideration is given to various input parameters and distance metrics.}

      \field{abstract}{Drones, also called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), have witnessed a remarkable development in recent decades. In agriculture, they have changed farming practices by offering farmers substantial cost savings, increased operational efficiency, and better profitability. Over the past decades, the topic of agricultural drones has attracted remarkable academic attention. We therefore conduct a comprehensive review based on bibliometrics to summarize and structure existing academic literature and reveal current research trends and hotspots. We apply bibliometric techniques and analyze the literature surrounding agricultural drones to summarize and assess previous research. Our analysis indicates that remote sensing, precision agriculture, deep learning, machine learning, and the Internet of Things are critical topics related to agricultural drones. The co-citation analysis reveals six broad research clusters in the literature. This study is one of the first attempts to summarize drone research in agriculture and suggest future research directions.}

      \field{abstract}{The fast development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has brought a unique set of opportunities and challenges to both the civilian and military sectors. While drones have proven useful in sectors such as delivery, agriculture, and surveillance, their potential for abuse in illegal airspace invasions, privacy breaches, and security risks has increased the demand for improved detection and classification systems. This state-of-the-art review presents a detailed overview of current improvements in drone detection and classification techniques: highlighting novel strategies used to address the rising concerns about UAV activities. We investigate the threats and challenges faced due to drones' dynamic behavior, size and speed diversity, battery life, etc. Furthermore, we categorize the key detection modalities, including radar, radio frequency (RF), acoustic, and vision-based approaches, and examine their distinct advantages and limitations. The research also discusses the importance of sensor fusion methods and other detection approaches, including wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), cellular, and Internet of Things (IoT) networks, for improving the accuracy and efficiency of UAV detection and identification.}

      \field{abstract}{Traditional field inventories have been the standard method for collecting detailed forest attribute data. However, these methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, especially for large areas. In contrast, remote sensing technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have become viable alternatives for collecting forest structure data, providing high-resolution images, precision, and the ability to use various sensors. To explore this trend, a bibliometric review was conducted using the Scopus database to examine the evolution of scientific publications and assess the current state of research on using UAVs to estimate dendrometric variables in forest ecosystems. A total of 454 studies were identified, with 199 meeting the established inclusion criteria for further analysis. The findings indicated that China and the United States are the leading contributors to this research domain, with a notable increase in journal publications over the past five years. The predominant focus has been on planted forests, particularly utilizing RGB sensors attached to UAVs for variable estimation. The primary variables assessed using UAV technology include total tree height, DBH, above-ground biomass, and canopy area. Consequently, this review has highlighted the most influential studies in the field, establishing a foundation for future research directions.}

      \field{abstract}{The use of automated, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to deliver commercial packages is poised to become a new industry, significantly shifting energy use in the freight sector. Here we find the current practical range of multi-copters to be about 4 km with current battery technology, requiring a new network of urban warehouses or waystations as support. We show that, although drones consume less energy per package-km than delivery trucks, the additional warehouse energy required and the longer distances traveled by drones per package greatly increase the life-cycle impacts. Still, in most cases examined, the impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based delivery. Results suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the freight sector. To realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery, regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and limiting the size of drones.}

      \field{abstract}{The growing interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from both the scientific and industrial sectors has attracted a wave of new researchers and substantial investments in this expansive field. However, due to the wide range of topics and subdomains within UAV research, newcomers may find themselves overwhelmed by the numerous options available. It is therefore crucial for those involved in UAV research to recognize its interdisciplinary nature and its connections with other disciplines. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the UAV field, highlighting recent trends and advancements. Drawing on recent literature reviews and surveys, the review begins by classifying UAVs based on their flight characteristics. It then provides an overview of current research trends in UAVs, utilizing data from the Scopus database to quantify the number of scientific documents associated with each research direction and their interconnections. This paper also explores potential areas for further development in UAVs, including communication, artificial intelligence, remote sensing, miniaturization, swarming and cooperative control, and transformability. Additionally, it discusses the development of aircraft control, commonly used control techniques, and appropriate control algorithms in UAV research. Furthermore, this paper addresses the general hardware and software architecture of UAVs, their applications, and the key issues associated with them. It also provides an overview of current open source software and hardware projects in the UAV field. By presenting a comprehensive view of the UAV field, this paper aims to enhance our understanding of this rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary area of research.}

      \field{abstract}{In this paper, we introduce the vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD). A fleet of trucks equipped with drones delivers packages to customers. Drones can be dispatched from and picked up by the trucks at the depot or any of the customer locations. The objective is to minimize the maximum duration of the routes (i.e., the completion time). The VRPD is motivated by a number of highly influential companies such as Amazon, DHL, and Federal Express, actively involved in exploring the potential use of commercial drones for package delivery. After stating our simplifying assumptions, we pose a number of questions in order to study the maximum savings that can be obtained from using drones; we then derive a number of worst-case results. The worst-case results depend on the number of drones per truck and the speed of the drones relative to the speed of the truck.}

      \field{abstract}{The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is an extension of the classic capacitated vehicle routing problem, where not only trucks but drones are used to deliver parcels to customers. One distinctive feature of the VRPD is that a drone may travel with a truck, take off from its stop to serve customers, and land at a service hub to travel with another truck as long as the flying range and loading capacity limitations are satisfied. Routing trucks and drones in an integrated manner makes the problem much more challenging and different from classical vehicle routing literature. We propose a mixed integer programming model, and develop a branch-and-price algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on the instances randomly generated in a practical setting, and the results demonstrate the good computational performance of the proposed algorithm. We also conduct sensitivity analysis on a key factor that may affect the total cost of a solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{In the modern world, zero-carbon society has become a new buzzword of the era. Many projects have been initiated to develop alternatives not only to the environmental crisis but also to the shortage of fossil fuels. With successful projects in automobile technology, hydrogen fuel is now being tested and utilized as a sustainable green fuel in the aviation sector which will lead to zero carbon emission in the future. From the mid-20th century to the early 21st numerous countries and companies have funded multimillion projects to develop hydrogen-fueled aircraft. Empirical data show positive results for various projects. Consequently, large companies are investing in various innovations undertaken by re-searchers under their supervision. Over time, the efficiency of hydrogen-fueled aircraft has improved but the lack of refueling stations, large production cost, and consolidated carbon market share have impeded the path of hydrogen fuel being commercialized. In addition, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is another important element of the Aviation industry, Hydrogen started to be commonly used as an alternative fuel for heavy-duty drones using fuel cell technology. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the chrono-logical development of hydrogen-powered aircraft technology and potential aviation ap-plications for hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Furthermore, the major barriers to widespread adoption of hydrogen technology in aviation are identified, as are future research opportunities.(c) 2023 The Authors.

      \field{abstract}{Global economic and social life has been severely challenged since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 disease a pandemic. Travel, tourism and hospitality, in particular, has been massively impacted by the lockdowns used to maintain social distance to manage the disease. Robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interactions have gained an increased presence to help manage the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals, airports, transportation systems, recreation and scenic areas, hotels, restaurants, and communities in general. Humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other intelligent robots are used in many different ways to reduce human contact and the potential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including delivering materials, disinfecting and sterilizing public spaces, detecting or measuring body temperature, providing safety or security, and comforting and entertaining patients. While controversial in the past due to concerns over job losses and data privacy, the adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism will likely continue after the COVID-19 pandemic becomes less serious. Tourism scholars should seize this opportunity to develop robotic applications that enhance tourist experiences, the protection of natural and cultural resources, citizen participation in tourism development decision making, and the emergence of new `high-touch' employment opportunities for travel, tourism and hospitality workers.}
