{"text": "Title: Evaluating the Use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for Collecting Discontinuity Orientation Data for Rock Slope Stability Analysis Abstract: This study compared the reliability of discontinuity orientation data collected in 2016 using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) with traditional transit compass data as a control, to evaluate UAS-generated results for rock slope stability analysis. The 2016 UAS operations were primitive by 2020 standards. Lessons learned are reviewed and related to UAS procedures common today. Two sites in Virginia were selected: a cut slope along State Route 629 (Site 1) and an abandoned shale quarry below Cove Mountain (Site 2). For logistical reasons, a different UAS was used at each of the two sites. Overlapping images from UAS flights were used to create point clouds from which discontinuity orientation data were extracted. Discontinuity data from both UAS and transit compass methods were imported into Dips 7.0, Roc-Plane 3.0, and Swedge 6.0 software for stereonet, statistical, and kinematic analyses. Statistical evaluation of the data sets suggested better overall reliability of UAS results for Site 2 than for Site 1. Compared to transit compass data, Site 1 UAS results are reliable for plane failure analysis only, whereas Site 2 UAS results are reliable for analyzing all types of failure. Possible reasons for this include different drone systems used at the two sites with different navigation and camera characteristics, interference from high-voltage electrical transmission lines at Site 1, and biases in human versus artificial interpretations. Compensating for some identified factors is now simpler by adding surveyed ground-control points to the model. Representative compass data should always be acquired for quality assurance.

{"text": "Title: Mathematical Investigation on the Sustainability of UAV Logistics Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to make groundbreaking changes in the logistics industry. Leading logistics companies have been developing and testing their usage of UAVs recently as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective option. In this paper, we investigate how much the UAV delivery service is environmentally friendly compared to the traditional ground vehicle (GV) delivery service. Since there are fuel (battery) and loadable weight restrictions in the UAV delivery, multi-hopping of UAV is necessary, which may cause a large consumption of electrical energy. We present a two-phase approach. In Phase I, a new vehicle routing model to obtain optimal delivery schedules for both UAV-alone and GV-alone delivery systems is proposed, which considers each system's restrictions, such as the max loadable weight and fuel replenishment. In Phase II, CO2 emissions are computed as a sustainability measure based on the travelling distance of the optimal route obtained from Phase I, along with various GV travel-speeds. A case study finds that the UAV-alone delivery system is much more CO2 efficient in all ranges of the GV speeds investigated. ", "label": "True"}

{"text": "Title: The economic and operational value of using drones to transport vaccines Abstract: Background: Immunization programs in low and middle income countries (LMICs) face numerous challenges in getting life-saving vaccines to the people who need them. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has progressed in recent years, potential use cases for UAVs have proliferated due to their ability to traverse difficult terrains, reduce labor, and replace fleets of vehicles that require costly maintenance. Methods: Using a HERMES-generated simulation model, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) for routine vaccine distribution under a range of circumstances reflecting variations in geography, population, road conditions, and vaccine schedules. We also identified the UAV payload and UAS costs necessary for a UAS to be favorable over a traditional multi-tiered land transport system (TMLTS). Results: Implementing the UAS in the baseline scenario improved vaccine availability (96% versus 94%) and produced logistics cost savings of $0.08 per dose administered as compared to the TMLTS. The UAS maintained cost savings in all sensitivity analyses, ranging from $0.05 to $0.21 per dose administered. The minimum UAV payloads necessary to achieve cost savings over the TMLTS, for the various vaccine schedules and UAS costs and lifetimes tested, were substantially smaller (up to 0.40 L) than the currently assumed UAV payload of 1.5 L. Similarly, the maximum UAS costs that could achieve savings over the TMLTS were greater than the currently assumed costs under realistic flight conditions. Conclusion: Implementing a UAS could increase vaccine availability and decrease costs in a wide range of settings and circumstances if the drones are used frequently enough to overcome the capital costs of installing and maintaining the system. Our computational model showed that major drivers of costs savings from using UAS are road speed of traditional land vehicles, the number of people needing to be vaccinated, and the distance that needs to be traveled. 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Release of R. latipes is challenging with the current visit-and-hand release approach because P. perfoliata shows a high degree of patchiness in the landscape, possesses recurved barbs on its stems, and often spreads into hard-to-access areas. This 3-year study developed and evaluated unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for precise aerial release of R. latipes to control P. perfoliata. RESULTSWe have developed two UAS (i.e. quad-rotor and tri-rotor) and an aerial release system to disseminate R. latipes. These include pods containing R. latipes and a dispenser to accommodate eight pods. Results of field tests to evaluate the systems showed no significant (P>0.05) effects on survivorship and feeding ability of R. latipes after aerial release. CONCLUSIONOur study demonstrates the potential of UAS for precision aerial release of biological control agents to control invasive plants. The aerial deployment systems we have developed, including both pods and a dispenser, are low cost, logistically practical, and effective with no negative effects on aerially released R. latipes.

{"text": "Title: Optimizing Spectral and Spatial Resolutions of Unmanned Aerial System Imaging Sensors for Monitoring Antarctic Vegetation Abstract: Antarctic moss communities, found in the spatially fragmented and fragile moss beds, can serve as indicators of the regional impacts of climate change. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) carrying visible and near infrared (VNIR) sensors are a suitable nonintrusive mapping platform. UAS deployments in Antarctica are, due to weather and logistical restrictions, infrequent and short, thus it is essential that field time is optimized. This article identified the optimal spectral and spatial resolution of the UAS-based sensors to facilitate efficient data acquisition without jeopardizing the accuracy of remotely sensed moss health indicators. A hyperspectral line scanner was used to collect imagery of two moss study sites near the Casey Australian Antarctic base. The spectral and spatial data degradation simulated two lightweight sensors that could be used for more efficient spectral image acquisition in the future. These simulations revealed that the spectral quality deteriorated more definitively at the spatial resolution where moss spectra started to mix with spectra of surrounding rocks. Subsequently, random forest models (RFMs) were trained with lab measurements for predicting chlorophyll content and effective leaf density. The RFMs were applied to the UAS imagery of the reduced spectral and spatial resolutions to quantify decline in accuracy of both indicators. We identified the optimal UAS sensor capable of mapping a relatively large moss bed (similar to 5 ha) with the prediction accuracy similar to the hyperspectral system. This sensor would be a frame camera acquiring 25 VNIR spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 8 cm.

There is an approach to evaluating its effectiveness based on a generalized multiplicative criterion, which takes into account the features of this system to the maximum extent. It is proposed to single out two particular criteria that characterize the reliability of a UAV and the effectiveness of the control system in relation to it. At the same time, the generalized criterion is a multiplicative convolution based not on the triangular-norm (t-norm) of the particular criterion, but of its correspondence functions, which in a certain way reflect its significance. It is shown that in the particular case of linear dependence of the correspondence functions, the generalized criterion coincides with the classical multiplicative convolution in the form of product of event probabilities.

Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits.

In this study we assessed the level of disturbance that a range of UAV shapes and sizes had on free-living non-breeding waterfowl surveyed in two sites in eastern Australia between March and May 2015, as well as the capability of airborne digital imaging systems to provide adequate resolution for unambiguous species identification of these taxa. We found little or no obvious disturbance effects on wild, mixed-species flocks of waterfowl when UAVs were flown at least 60m above the water level (fixed wing models) or 40m above individuals (multirotor models). Disturbance in the form of swimming away from the UAV through to leaving the water surface and flying away from the UAV was visible at lower altitudes and when fixed-wing UAVs either approached subjects directly or rapidly changed altitude arid/or direction near animals. Using tangential approach flight paths that did not cause disturbance, commercially available onboard optical equipment was able to capture images of sufficient quality to identify waterfowl and even much smaller taxa such as swallows.

Critically Endangered [A3cd] golden-crowned sifakas (Propithecus tattersalli) are medium-sized, white lemurs whose creamy colour contrasts against defoliated tree canopies, making them an ideal study species for aerial counts. Quad-copter UAV flights over sifaka groups did not elicit antipredator responses. Photographs demonstrated the ability of UAVs to capture viable imagery of sifakas from approximately 20 m above ground level. Unfortunately, crashes resulting from an inability to programme automated flights over hilly forests cut this pilot study short, highlighting several challenges that remain to implementing UAVs in remote field studies. This study demonstrates that while UAVs offer considerable promise in the future of primate research and conservation, high start-up costs and remote field conditions provide challenging obstacles to first time users hoping to use this exciting new technology. Furthermore, we strongly recommend that thermal cameras be used for direct primate counts with UAVs. ", "label": "False"}

Previous studies often based their UAV logistics delivery strategies on Manhattan distance.

Innovative approaches are needed to overcome these challenges. This study explores a multi-user UAV cargo delivery system, where a cellular-connected UAV efficiently collects and distributes packages within a delivery area. Balancing task completion speed and reliable communication with ground base stations (GBS) poses challenges due to the problem's highly non-convex nature. To address this, we propose a two-step approach. Initially, leveraging a graph-theoretic method under communication quality constraints, we determine the shortest path between points ensuring communication connectivity. Subsequently, considering pickup and delivery with capacity constraints based on communication connectivity (PDPCC), we present an efficient solution for obtaining the optimal task sequence and integrating it with the shortest paths. Our numerical results demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy in reducing delivery task completion time while ensuring continuous online UAV operation through maintained communication connectivity.

To derive an objective framework for choosing among technologies we calculated efficiency measures and conducted a data envelopment productivity frontier analysis (DEA) to compare the efficacy of using manned aircraft (Cessna with Aviatrix triggered image capture using a 50 mm lens) and UAS (Mavic Pro 2) for photogrammetric monitoring of restoration efforts in dynamic braided rivers in Southern New Zealand.

The results reveal that the technological and logistic aspects of UASs were more efficient than manned aircraft flights. Administratively, the first deployment of UASs is less efficient but was very flexible for subsequent deployment. Manned aircraft flights were more productive in terms of the number of acquired images, but the ground resolution of those images was lower compared with those from UASs.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a viable and inexpensive option for studying the cryospheric components at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions. UAVs are adaptable to various cryospheric research needs in terms of providing flexibility with data acquisition windows, revisits, data/sensor types (multispectral, hyperspectral, microwave, thermal/night imaging, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and photogrammetric stereos), viewing angles, flying altitudes, and overlap dimensions.

UAVs, like satellites and aircraft can provide a synoptic view of a relatively large area. However, the coarse resolution provided by satellites and the operational limitations of manned aircraft has motivated the development of unmanned systems.

Here, we present the development of cutting-edge payload instrumentation for UAVs that provides a new capability for ship-deployed operations to capture a unique, high resolution spatial and temporal variability of the changing air-sea interaction processes than was previously possible. The modular design of the base payload means that new instruments can be incorporated into new research proposals that may include new instruments for expanded use of the payloads as a long-term research facility. Additionally, we implement a novel capability for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) from research vessels. This VTOL capability is safer and requires less logistical support than previous ship-deployed systems. The payloads developed include thermal infrared, visible broadband and hyperspectral, and near-infrared hyperspectral high-resolution imaging.

There are notable impediments to the utilization of commercial logistic-oriented fixed-wing UAVs, including elevated procurement and maintenance costs, extensive maintenance intervals, and unsuitability for small-volume, low-altitude transport tasks. These factors collectively exacerbate the risk associated with enterprise procurement and elevate the cost-benefit ratio. This study introduces the design and fabrication of a cost-efficient UAV for logistic delivery purposes, constructed primarily from cost-effective wood materials. This UAV is engineered to ferry payloads of up to 1000 g across a predefined aerial route at an altitude of 40 m. Upon reaching the designated location, the UAV is programmed to initiate the identification of the drop zone, thereafter descending to facilitate the release of the cargo. To mitigate the impact force during the landing phase, the payload was encapsulated within a sponge-damping layer, thereby preserving the integrity of the transported items. The empirical findings from outdoor delivery trials underscore the UAV's ability to precisely execute payload drops at the targeted locations, confirming its potential to fulfill the logistical requirements for the transportation and delivery of small-volume items in a cost-effective, low-altitude framework.

In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight; flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to rendezvous with the truck.

Thus, multiple unmanned vehicles with well-planned routes become necessary to minimize the unnecessary consumption of time, distance, and energy while carrying out the delivery missions. The aim of the present study was to develop a multiple-vehicle mission dispatch system that can automatically compile a set of optimal paths and avoid passing through no-travel zones. For this function, the A* search algorithm was adopted to determine an alternative path that does not cross the no-travel zone when the distance array is set, and an improved two-phased Tabu search was applied to converge any initial solutions into a feasible solution. In this study, a group of five multicopters was set up to validate the swarm system, and the result shows that our improved 2TS+2OPT is able to converge to a better solution that allows logistic UAV swarms to operate in a more efficient way.

However, the utilization of UAV swarms in sustainable transportation also presents some challenges, such as inefficient task allocation and data transmission security issues, highlighting the importance of privacy protection in this context. To address these issues, this study applies blockchain technology to multi-UAV tasks and proposes a blockchain-based multi-UAV task processing system for situation awareness and real-time decisions. The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency of UAV swarm task scheduling, bolster data transmission security, and address privacy protection concerns. Utilizing the highly secure features of blockchain technology, the system constructs a distributed task processing network. System tasks are stored in the blockchain through smart contracts, ensuring the immutability and verifiability of task information. Smart contracts have an automatic execution capability, whereby the system can efficiently coordinate tasks and maintain the consistency of task execution information through consensus mechanisms. Additionally, adopting the Pointer Network structure for intelligent path planning based on task allocation results leads to the attainment of the shortest service routes, consequently expanding the service coverage of sustainable transportation systems while reducing energy consumption. This further advances the realization of urban sustainable transportation. Through experimental results, we verify that the proposed system enables real-time task scheduling and collaborative processing for multiple UAVs, significantly enhancing the efficiency, security, and privacy protection level of UAV swarm task execution in the context of sustainable transportation.

More importantly, the UAV-borne aeromagnetometry can be performed at low altitudes, which makes it possible to resolve fine features otherwise only evident in ground surveys. Developing such a UAV-borne aeromagnetometry system is challenging owing to strong magnetic interference introduced by onboard electric and electronic components. An experiment concerning the static magnetic interference of the UAV was conducted to assess the severity of the interference of a hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV. The results of the static experiment show that the wing area is highly magnetic due to the proximity to servomotors and motors, whereas the area along the longitudinal axis of the UAV has a relatively smaller magnetic signature. Assisted by the static experiment and aerodynamic simulations, we first proposed a front-mounting solution with two compact magnetometers. Subsequently, two dynamic experiments were conducted with the setup to assess the dynamic interference of the system. The results of the dynamic experiments reveal that the strongest source of in-flight magnetic interference is the current-carrying cables connecting the battery to the flight controller and that this effect is most influential during pitch maneuvers of the aircraft.

With the maturity of unmanned technology, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is becoming a promising alternative to the problematic manual inspection. However, due to the lack of GPS signal indoor, the localization of UAVs is a big challenge to achieve fully autonomous inspection. Moreover, the narrow and complex indoor environment makes it difficult to guarantee flight safety.

Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This \"Ecosynth\" methodology applies photogrammetric \"Structure from Motion\" computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (<130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (<USD$4000), lightweight (<2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30-67 points M-2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 625 ha (250 m x 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2-4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4-12 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R-2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31-36% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m x 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology. Inexpensive user-deployed technologies for multispectral 3D scanning of vegetation at landscape scales (<1 km(2)) heralds a new era of participatory remote sensing by field ecologists, community foresters and the interested public.

With recent humanitarian field tests of cargo UAVs as indication that implementation may soon become reality, a priori assessment of a smart-navigated (autonomous) UAV disaster cargo fleet via simulation modeling and analysis is vital to the best-practice development process. Logistical problems with ground transport of relief supplies in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (2017) pose a compelling use scenario for UAV disaster cargo delivery. In this context, we introduce a General Purpose Assessment Model (GPAM) that can estimate the potential effectiveness of a cargo UAV fleet for any given response region. We evaluate this model using the following standards: (i) realistic specifications; (ii) stable output for various realistic specifications; and (iii) support of humanitarian goals. To this end, we discuss data from humanitarian cargo delivery field tests and feedback from practitioners, perform sensitivity analyses, and demonstrate the advantage of using humanitarian rather than geographic distance in making fleet delivery assignments. We conclude with several major challenges faced by those who wish to implement smart-navigated UAV cargo fleets in disaster response, and the need for further GPAM development.

The flexible maneuverability of UAVs also means that the UAV often operates in complex 3D environments, which requires efficient and reliable path planning system support. However, as a limited resource platform, the UAV systems cannot support highly complex path planning algorithms in lots of scenarios. In this paper, we propose a 3D spatial information compression (3DSIC) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for UAV path planning in cluttered 3D environments. Specifically, the proposed algorithm compresses the 3D spatial information to 2D through 3DSIC, and then combines the compressed 2D environment information with the current UAV layer spatial information to train UAV agents for path planning using neural networks. Additionally, the proposed 3DSIC is a plug and use module that can be combined with various DRL frameworks such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Our simulation results show that the training efficiency of 3DSIC-DQN is 4.028 times higher than that directly implementing DQN in a $100 \\times 100 \\times 50$ 3D cluttered environment. Furthermore, the training efficiency of 3DSIC-DDPG is 3.9 times higher than the traditional DDPG in the same environment.

UAVs provide various services to users, including monitoring, logistics, and sensing, because of their flexible deployment and dynamic reconfigurability. However, UAV networks have become more susceptible to malicious threats because of their multiconnectivity and openness. A great effort has been made to develop an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) based on machine-learning approaches for UAVs. Unfortunately, existing methods were unable to identify real time and zero-day attacks for UAV networks. This is due to that existing methods have still used obsolete data sets and past knowledge-based detection. Also, the shortcomings of standalone IDS render them unsuitable for defending UAV networks from potential security risks. Further, the lack of precise identification for compromised UAV nodes in UAV networks poses a critical security gap, risking the entire network's integrity with the compromise of a single node. Therefore, in this work, we propose an autonomous collaborative IDS (UAV-CIDS) with a feedforward convolutional neural network (FFCNN), which accurately identifies zero-day with high accuracy. The proposed solution takes into account encoded Wi-Fi traffic logs of three popular UAVs types: 1) DBPower UDI; 2) parrot Bebop; and 3) DJI spark. Evaluation results indicate that our FFCNN model has produced outstanding results based on the UAVIDS data set with 98.23% accuracy compared to existing models. After the detection of attacks, their mitigation is equally significant. In addition, we also design and implement real-time incident response handling against cyber-attacks on UAV Networks.

Hence, this paper aims to analyze the various barriers hindering the implementation of UAVs in humanitarian logistics for both developed and developing nations.

Optimal use of UAVs in dynamic environments is important in many aspects, e.g., increasing efficacy and reducing the air traffic, resulting in a safer environment, and it requires new techniques and robust approaches based on the capabilities of UAVs and constraints. This paper analyzes several delivery schemes within a platform, such as delivery with and without using air highways and delivery using a hybrid scheme along with several delivery methods (i.e., optimal, premium, and first-in first-out) to explore the use of UAV swarms as part of the logistics operations. In this platform, a dimension reduction technique, \"dynamic multiple assignments in multidimensional space,\" and several other new techniques along with Hungarian and cross-entropy Monte Carlo techniques are forged together to assign tasks and plan 3D routes dynamically. This particular approach is performed in such a way that UAV swarms in several warehouses are deployed optimally given the delivery scheme, method, and constraints. Several scenarios are tested on the simulator using small and big data sets. The results show that the distribution and the characteristics of data sets and constraints affect the decision on choosing the optimal delivery scheme and the method.

The rapid development of UAM has brought innovation and dynamism to many industries, especially in the field of logistics. Various types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for use in transport logistics are being designed and produced. UAV logistics refers to the use of UAVs, usually carrying goods and parcels, to achieve route planning, identify risk perception, facilitate parcel delivery, and carry out other functions. This research provides a method for assessing the operational capacity of a UAV logistics route network. The concept of \"logistics UAV route network operation capacity\" is defined, and a bi-objective optimization model for assessing the route network's operating capacity is developed. The first objective is to maximize the number of UAV logistics delivery plans that can be executed in a fixed operation time. The second objective is to minimize the total operational impedance value in a fixed operation time. To solve the bi-objective optimization model, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is utilized. A UAV logistics route network with 62 nodes is developed to assess the rationale and validity of the proposed concept. The experiments show that with an increase in operation time, the route network's optimal operational capacity gradually increases, the convergence speed of the algorithm slows down, and the optimization magnitude gradually reduces. Two key parameters-operational safety interval and flight speed-are further analyzed in the experiments. According to the experiments, as the safety interval increases, the route network's average operational capacity steadily diminishes, as does its sensitivity to the safety interval. The average operational capacity steadily rose with the rise in flight speed, especially when the UAV logistics flight speed was between 10 m/s and 10.5 m/s. In that range, the operational capacity of the route network was substantially impacted by the flight speed. ", "label": "True"}

The combination of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) with structure from motion (SfM) methods have already revolutionized the current close-range Earth observation paradigm. To test their feasibility in characterizing the properties and dynamics of fast ice, three flights were carried out in the 2016-2017 austral summer during the 33rd Chinese National Antarctic Expedition (CHINARE), focusing on the area of the Prydz Bay in East Antarctica. Three-dimensional models and orthomosaics from three sorties were constructed from a total of 205 photos using Agisoft PhotoScan software. Logistical challenges presented by the terrain precluded the deployment of a dedicated ground control network; however, it was still possible to indirectly assess the performance of the photogrammetric products through an analysis of the statistics of the matching network, bundle adjustment, and Monte-Carlo simulation. Our results show that the matching networks are quite strong, given a sufficient number of feature points (mostly > 20,000) or valid matches (mostly > 1000). The largest contribution to the total error using our direct georeferencing approach is attributed to inaccuracies in the onboard position and orientation system (POS) records, especially in the vehicle height and yaw angle. On one hand, the 3D precision map reveals that planimetric precision is usually about one-third of the vertical estimate (typically 20 cm in the network centre). On the other hand, shape-only errors account for less than 5% for the X and Y dimensions and 20% for the Z dimension. To further illustrate the UAS's capability, six representative surface features are selected and interpreted by sea ice experts.

In this era of rapid global and regional climate change, it is becoming increasingly necessary to employ UAVs to investigate the finer changes in the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) and ice shelves. This work investigates the use of UAVs in the monitoring of the glacial microtopography (including rifts and crevasses, surface subsidence, and melting ponds), ice surface landforms, atmosphere, flora and fauna, sea ice, subglacial environment, and other aspects of Antarctic glaciology investigation, and it speculates on their future use in multidisciplinary research.

{"text": "Title: Energy-aware decision-making for dynamic task migration in MEC-based unmanned aerial vehicle delivery system Abstract: Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in many smart systems such as smart logistics, smart agriculture, and environmental monitoring systems. However, the limited computing capability and restricted battery lifetime of existing UAVs could significantly impact the quality of service (QoS) of UAV-based smart systems and the quality of experience (QoE) of end users. Recently, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) which provisions computing resources close to the mobile end devices has become a promising solution. However, since high-speed UAV often flies through the signal range of the different edge nodes, the interruption of services in the MEC-based UAV delivery system is a critical issue. A challenging question is when and how to perform dynamic task migration among the edge nodes to ensure service continuity. In this paper, we investigate the task migration issue for multiple UAVs in the MEC-based UAV delivery system. Specifically, we propose an energy-aware decision-making strategy for the dynamic task migration named GAD to optimize the UAV energy consumption. Given the real-time system status and QoS constraints, and through a dynamic two-tier decision-making mechanism, GAD can efficiently make the task migration decision from four candidate decisions, viz. No Migration, Data Migration Only, Cold Migration, and Live Migration. Experimental results based on a real-world scenario show that our strategy can well outperform other baseline strategies in various metrics including the flying distances and the energy consumption of UAVs.

Three UAVs picked up and dropped 23 circular and rectangular targets into a designated drop box. To control the operation of three UAVs flying over an arena of 90 x 60 m, we designed and integrated a set of technologies into our system: airspace allocation, communication framework among UAVs, anticollision based on geofencing, and a token-based prioritization for coordination. The proposed UAV system uses a single GPS and its error of a few meters is solved by means of the following component technologies: (a) flight path generator based on one reference point, (b) vision-based redefinition of a reference point for GPS correction, and (c) calibration of flight path to update the reference point. The pickup-and-drop mission is conducted via color- and shape-based vision processing and a magnetic gripper to pickup and drop-off the targets. Our proposed system is able to successfully manage three UAVs, recognize targets on the ground, and drop the targets into a drop box in the drop zone.

{"text": "Title: A POMDP Approach to Map Victims in Disaster Scenarios Abstract: Background: The rise in natural and man-made disasters has increased the need for effective search-and-rescue tools, particularly in resource-limited areas. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for this purpose due to their flexibility and lower operational costs. However, finding the most efficient paths for these UAVs remains a challenge, as it is essential to maximize victim location and minimize mission time. Methods: This study presents an autonomous UAV-based approach for identifying victims, prioritizing high-risk areas and those needing urgent medical attention. Unlike other methods focused solely on minimizing mission time, this approach emphasizes high-risk zones and potential secondary disaster areas. Using a partially observable Markov decision process, it simulates victim detection through an image classification algorithm, enabling efficient and independent operation. Results: Experiments with real data indicate that this approach reduces risk by 66% during the mission's first half while autonomously identifying victims without human intervention. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the capability of autonomous UAV systems to improve search-and-rescue efforts in disaster-prone, resource-constrained regions by effectively prioritizing high-risk areas, thereby reducing mission risk and improving response efficiency.

The non-invasive aspect of UAS and the ability to collect a large amount of high-resolution imagery should be of interest to polar bear (Ursus maritimus) researchers who face logistic challenges with field work and developing minimally invasive methods. We opportunistically observed the behavioural reactions of three adult male polar bears during UAS surveys in the summer of 2016. We recorded vigilance behaviours and compared them to previously published vigilance behaviours during wildlife-viewing activities by Dyck and Baydack (2004). The number of vigilance events was 13.4 +/- 3.7 (SE) and vigilance bout lengths was 18.7 +/- 2.6 s (SE), which is similar to reported results by Dyck and Baydack (2004). To estimate detection probabilities of polar bears from UAS imagery, we had two independent observers review mosaics and 80% of known bear locations were identified. Our preliminary results suggest that UAS are capable of detecting polar bears using RGB imagery in a relatively non-invasive manner. Before UAS can be integrated into large-scale polar bear studies, further research is required to formally assess behavioural impacts with unhabituated individuals in the wild, and model factors influencing detection probabilities.

The main participants were the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University and Zhejiang Antwork Technology Co., Ltd. We first constructed an urban medical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery system and developed a UAV-specific storage box for COVID-19 samples. The UAV system was used to transport COVID-19 throat swab samples from the northern hospital district to the southern hospital district, and the following indexes were obtained: (1) flight time of COVID-19 samples delivered by UAV, (2) real-time temperature of COVID-19 nucleic acid samples during transportation, and (3) the time of distribution of COVID-19 nucleic acid samples by road traffic as measured using the Baidu Maps application, compared with the flight time of UAV. The COVID-19 sample delivery system for urban medical UAV mainly consists of intelligent logistics UAV, low-temperature COVID-19 throat swab sample storage box, unmanned logistics hub, and cloud operation control platform. The flight distance between the northern and southern districts of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University was 10 km, and the ground distance was 24 km. From May 11 to October 28, 2022, a total of 1,190 UAV flights occurred. The average flight time was 13 minutes, which was 40 to 70 minutes faster than the average road travel time required for manual delivery of COVID-19 throat swab samples.

{"text": "Title: The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem: Optimization of drone-assisted parcel delivery Abstract: Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

{"text": "Title: Quantifying submerged fluvial topography using hyperspatial resolution UAS imagery and structure from motion photogrammetry Abstract: Quantifying the topography of rivers and their associated bedforms has been a fundamental concern of fluvial geomorphology for decades. Such data, acquired at high temporal and spatial resolutions, are increasingly in demand for process-oriented investigations of flow hydraulics, sediment dynamics and in-stream habitat. In these riverine environments, the most challenging region for topographic measurement is the wetted, submerged channel. Generally, dry bed topography and submerged bathymetry are measured using different methods and technology. This adds to the costs, logistical challenges and data processing requirements of comprehensive river surveys. However, some technologies are capable of measuring the submerged topography. Through-water photogrammetry and bathymetric LiDAR are capable of reasonably accurate measurements of channel beds in clear water. While the cost of bathymetric LiDAR remains high and its resolution relatively coarse, the recent developments in photogrammetry using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms promise a fundamental shift in the accessibility of topographic data for a wide range of settings. Here we present results demonstrating the potential of so called SfM-photogrammetry for quantifying both exposed and submerged fluvial topography at the mesohabitat scale. We show that imagery acquired from a rotary-winged Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) can be processed in order to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) with hyperspatial resolutions (c. 0.02m) for two different river systems over channel lengths of 50-100m. Errors in submerged areas range from 0.016m to 0.089m, which can be reduced to between 0.008m and 0.053m with the application of a simple refraction correction. This work therefore demonstrates the potential of UAS platforms and SfM-photogrammetry as a single technique for surveying fluvial topography at the mesoscale (defined as lengths of channel from c.10m to a few hundred metres).

In typical use cases, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can be applied to monitoring and logistics have received wide attention. However, subject to their own flexible maneuverability, limited computational capability, and battery energy, UAVs need to offload computation-intensive tasks to ensure the quality of service. In this paper, we solve this problem for UAV systems in a 5G heterogeneous network environment by proposing an innovative distributed framework that jointly considers transmission assessment and task offloading. Specifically, we devised a fuzzy logic-based offloading assessment mechanism at the UAV side, which can adaptively avoid risky wireless links based on the motion state of an UAV and performance transmission metrics. We introduce a multi-agent advantage actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable the UAVs to optimize the system utility by learning the best policies from the environment. This requires decisions on computing modes as well as the choices of radio access technologies (RATs) and MEC servers in the case of offloading.

We improve upon other 2D single-shot detection methods by estimating a 3D box containing the aircraft, which allows us to capture a vehicle's position and attitude as measurements. Using a constant-jerk Kalman filter, we then estimate the complete aircraft state from these measurements.

Numerous UAS and sensors are available and have been used in various methods. However, justification for selection or methods used are not typically offered in published literature. Furthermore, existing reviews do not adequately cover past and current UAS applications for animal monitoring, nor their associated UAS/sensor characteristics and environmental considerations. We present a systematic map that collects and consolidates evidence pertaining to UAS monitoring of animals.MethodsWe investigated the current state of knowledge on UAS applications in terrestrial animal monitoring by using an accurate, comprehensive, and repeatable systematic map approach. We searched relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature, as well as dissertations and theses, using online publication databases, Google Scholar, and by request through a professional network of collaborators and publicly available websites. We used a tiered approach to article exclusion with eligible studies being those that monitor (i.e., identify, count, estimate, etc.) terrestrial vertebrate animals. Extracted metadata concerning UAS, sensors, animals, methodology, and results were recorded in Microsoft Access. We queried and catalogued evidence in the final database to produce tables, figures, and geographic maps to accompany this full narrative review, answering our primary and secondary questions.Review findingsWe found 5539 articles from our literature searches of which 216 were included with extracted metadata categories in our database and narrative review. Studies exhibited exponential growth over time but have levelled off between 2019 and 2021 and were primarily conducted in North America, Australia, and Antarctica. Each metadata category had major clusters and gaps, which are described in the narrative review.ConclusionsOur systematic map provides a useful synthesis of current applications of UAS-animal related studies and identifies major knowledge clusters (well-represented subtopics that are amenable to full synthesis by a systematic review) and gaps (unreported or underrepresented topics that warrant additional primary research) that guide future research directions and UAS applications. The literature for the use of UAS to conduct animal surveys has expanded intensely since its inception in 2006 but is still in its infancy. Since 2015, technological improvements and subsequent cost reductions facilitated widespread research, often to validate UAS technology to survey single species with application of descriptive statistics over limited spatial and temporal scales. Studies since the 2015 expansion have still generally focused on large birds or mammals in open landscapes of 4 countries, but regulations, such as maximum altitude and line-of-sight limitations, remain barriers to improved animal surveys with UAS. Critical knowledge gaps include the lack of (1) best practices for using UAS to conduct standardized surveys in general, (2) best practices to survey whole wildlife communities in delineated areas, and (3) data on factors affecting bias in counting animals from UAS images. Promising advances include the use of thermal sensors in forested environments or nocturnal surveys and the development of automated or semi-automated machine-learning algorithms to accurately detect, identify, and count animals from UAS images.

Effective management of forests requires accurate, precise estimates of deer population abundance to plan and justify management actions. Spotlight surveys in combination with distance sampling are a common method of estimating deer population abundance; however, spotlight surveys are known to have serious drawbacks such as high costs and sampling biases. Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of enumerating deer from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights, conducted 1 and 6 March 2018, to develop population and density estimates in 2 United States National Parks: Harpers Ferry National Historic Park (HAFE) and Monocacy National Battlefield (MONO). Concurrent spotlight surveys at MONO enabled us to compare estimates obtained by the 2 methods. Deer density estimates by 4 observers of UAV-obtained thermal imagery from HAFE were 94.5 +/- 3.9 deer/km(2). Concurrent UAV and spotlight surveys at MONO found 19.7 +/- 0.5 deer/km(2) and 6.4 +/- 4.9 deer/km(2), respectively; suggesting that spotlight surveys may significantly underestimate deer densities. Despite the logistical challenges to UAV operation, our findings demonstrate that UAVs will become an invaluable tool for wildlife management as technology improves. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

Owing to logistical challenges that come with field-based inventory methods, remote sensing plays an important role in supplementing field methods to fill in data gaps.

{"text": "Title: The feasibility of counting songbirds using unmanned aerial vehicles Abstract: Obtaining unbiased survey data for vocal bird species is inherently challenging due to observer biases, habitat coverage biases, and logistical constraints. We propose that combining bioacoustic monitoring with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology could reduce some of these biases and allow bird surveys to be conducted in less accessible areas. We tested the feasibility of the UAV approach to songbird surveys using a low-cost quadcopter with a simple, lightweight recorder suspended 8 m below the vehicle. In a field experiment using playback of bird recordings, we found that small variations in UAV altitude (it hovered at 28, 48, and 68 m) didn't have a significant effect on detections by the recorder attached to the UAV, and we found that the detection radius of our equipment was comparable with detection radii of standard point counts. We then field tested our equipment, comparing songbird detections from our UAV-mounted recorder with standard point-count data from 51 count stations. We found that the number of birds per point on UAV counts was comparable with standard counts for most species, but there were significant underestimates for some-specifically, issues of song masking for a species with a low-frequency song, the Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura); and underestimation of the abundance of a species that was found in very high densities, the Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis). Species richness was lower on UAV counts (mean = 5.6 species point(-1)) than on standard counts (8.3 species point (-1)), but only slightly lower than on standard counts if nonaudible detections are omitted (6.5 species point (-1)). Excessive UAV noise is a major hurdle to using UAVs for bioacoustic monitoring, but we are optimistic that technological innovations to reduce motor and rotor noise will significantly reduce this issue. We conclude that UAV-based bioacoustic monitoring holds great promise, and we urge other researchers to consider further experimentation to refine techniques. ", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Adaptive mutant particle swarm optimization based precise cargo airdrop of unmanned aerial vehicles Abstract: Emerging unmanned system technologies and smart logistics have motivated logistics enterprises to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for last-mile cargo delivery through the air so as to benefit from its flexibility and low cost. It is useful to deliver cargoes by airdrops from fixed-wing UAVs. However, wind and parameter errors of the UAV could make the cargo deviate from the desired landing point. To improve the accuracy of airdrop methods, this paper presents the Continuously Computed Release Point under conditions of strong wind (SW-CCRP) airdrop strategy to transport the cargo to a given position by a fixed-wing UAV. In this strategy, a set of differential equations are used to model the cargo motion and wind perturbations are considered. Based on the established motion model and the kinematic relationships between the cargo and the target position, the expected release point can be accurately predicted in real time. In order to satisfy the precision requirement, the precision assignment is studied to determine the permissible parameter error ranges. In view of that the conventional precision assignment methods are difficult to be applied in the airdrop system because of its complexity and strong nonlinearity, an adaptive mutant particle swarm optimization (AMPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, in which the adaptive inertia weight can balance the global and local search. In addition, the mutation factor of the AMPSO is able to avoid premature convergence and stagnation.

This work considers the problem of designing a smooth dynamic feedback control law for a point mass payload suspended to a quadrotor and making the load to follow a large class of curves that includes both closed and non-closed curves. Typically, the load path following problem is solved using either a coordinate-free or a local-coordinate-based approach. However, in this article, we adopt an alternative methodology. First, we express the system dynamics in an extended Euclidean space using a global coordinate system. Second, we propose two families of functions that lead to the design of almost-global and local controllers in terms of region of convergence. We cast the load path following the problem in the framework of set stabilization, and as a result, the proposed controllers make the given path an invariant manifold. The resulting controllers guarantee that once the suspended load converges to the path, it stays on the path indefinitely while satisfying other application-specific constraints. Finally, to complement the theoretical results, we provide a successful real-world experimental validation of the proposed controller on a Quanser QDrone UAV platform with a cable-suspended payload.

Drone-imagery methods can observe larger extents to estimate indicators at landscape scales with higher confidence than traditional field sampling. They also have the potential to replace field methods in some instances and enable the development of indicators not measurable from the ground. Much research has already demonstrated that several quantitative rangeland indicators can be estimated from high-resolution imagery. Developing a suite of monitoring methods that are useful for supporting management decisions (e.g., repeatable, cost-effective, and validated against field methods) will require additional exploration to develop best practices for image acquisition and analytical workflows that can efficiently estimate multiple indicators. We embedded with a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field monitoring crew in Northern California, USA to compare field-measured and imagery-derived indicator values and to evaluate the logistics of using small UAS within the framework of an existing monitoring program. The unified workflow we developed to measure fractional cover, canopy gaps, and vegetation height was specific for the sagebrush steppe, an ecosystem that is common in other BLM managed lands. The correspondence between imagery and field methods yielded encouraging agreement while revealing systematic differences between the methods. Workflow best practices for producing repeatable rangeland indicators is likely to vary by vegetation composition and phenology. An online space dedicated to sharing imagery-based workflows could spur collaboration among researchers and quicken the pace of integrating drone-imagery data within adaptive management of rangelands. Though drone-imagery methods are not likely to replace most field methods in large monitoring programs, they could be a valuable enhancement for pressing local management needs. ", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: A Two-Stage Approach of Joint Route Planning and Resource Allocation for Multiple UAVs in Unmanned Logistics Distribution Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as means of delivery to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of logistics distribution in various scenarios, such as emergency items delivery for disaster areas and logistics services for remote areas. This paper focuses on the problem of route planning for UAVs, which is the basis for UAVs to complete distribution tasks. Besides, to enhance the collaboration of UAVs during the delivery mission, this work also studies wireless resource (spectrum, power) allocation problem for multiple UAVs enabled communication networks. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial characteristics, it is challenging to obtain an optimal strategy for joint route planning and resource allocation issues within a finite time. To this end, the paths of UAVs are planned by the simulated annealing (SA) method in the first stage. Based on the preplanned paths, a double deep Q network (DDQN) based resource allocation method is proposed to maximize the average sum capacity of UAV-to-UAV (U2U) links and reduce transmission delay while minimizing the interference to UAV-to-infrastructure (U2I) links. Multi-UAV communication networks are reconnected according to the positions of UAVs changing in each time slot. Then each U2U link acting as an agent learns to improve spectrum and power allocation policy with imperfect knowledge of the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDQN-based resource management scheme can achieve higher system communication capacity than a random scheme. Moreover, the successful transmission probability of U2U links obtained by the DDQN-based method is much higher than a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based method. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: A novel hybrid Coyote-Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for three-dimensional constrained trajectory planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been considered the future of transportation systems. However, mostly the reported optimizers struggle to estimate the flyable trajectories within acceptable accuracy and time bound under various constraints, particularly in a complex 3D environment. Therefore, this work proposes a novel hybrid optimizer (HCPSOA) by combining the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA). Further, the chaotic logistic map and dynamic weight adjustments have been incorporated to enhance the exploration-exploitation capabilities. After validating the promising performance of HCPSOA against popular metaheuristics (COA, PSO, Improved COA, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, and Hybrid Fireworks PSO) for several benchmark functions, the proposed HCPSOA has been employed to estimate the flyable path by formulating a novel cost function and smoothened by cubic B-spline curve. The simulated results reveal that the HCPSOA provide a non -colliding path with up to 10.00% lesser average cost for the considered real world scenario (map 3), which confirms its supremacy for the estimation of the safe and flyable relative to other compared algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The initial part in reducing losses sourced from plant diseases is to make an accurate and earlier identification. Thus, the usage of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensors for surveying and assessing crops, orchards, and forests has rapidly elevated over the last decade, particularly for the stress management like water, diseases, nutrition deficits, and pests. Using Minkowski Distance-based Fuzzy C Means (MD-FCM) clustering and Xavier initialization-adapted Cosine Similarity-induced Radial Bias Function Neural Network (XCS-RBFNN) techniques, a UAV HS imaging remote sensor for Spatial and Temporal Resolution (STR) of mango plant disease and pest identification is proposed in this scheme. Collecting the input UAV source (image or video) is eventuated initially along with the Region of Interest (ROI) calculated which is followed by preprocessing. Leaf segmentation is eventuated using Logistic U-net after preprocessing. Next, MD-FCM performs clustering to cluster the diseased leaves and pests individually. The disease and pest characteristics are then retrieved separately and classified further. The requisite features are then chosen from the retrieved features utilizing the Levy Flight Distribution-produced Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (LFD-BOA). Finally, the XCS-RBFNN classifier is utilized to categorize the various diseases together with pests found in the UAV input source using the chosen features. The proposed framework's experimental findings are then compared to some prevailing schemes, with the results revealing that the proposed work outperforms other benchmark techniques.

Low cost unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can provide information on the spatial pattern of hosts' distribution and abundance, which is crucial as regards modelling the determinants of disease transmission and persistence on a fine spatial scale. In this context we have studied the spatial epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in the ungulate community of Donana National Park (South-western Spain) by modelling species host (red deer, fallow deer and cattle) abundance at fine spatial scale. The use of UAS high-resolution images has allowed us to collect data to model the environmental determinants of host abundance, and in a further step to evaluate their relationships with the spatial risk of TB throughout the ungulate community. We discuss the ecological, epidemiological and logistic conditions under which UAS may contribute to study the wildlife/livestock sanitary interface, where the spatial aggregation of hosts becomes crucial. These findings are relevant for planning and implementing research, fundamentally when managing disease in multi-host systems, and focusing on risky areas.

{"text": "Title: Energy Consumption Model of Aerial Urban Logistic Infrastructures Abstract: In the last decade, logistic systems based on small aerial vehicles (drones) have become attractive for urban delivery operations as a sustainable alternative to ground vehicles because they are not affected by the congestion of the road network, thus allowing for faster and more reliable services. Aerial logistic systems, however, require a substantially different approach to operations management and need specifically designed supportive infrastructures. While the research on urban aerial delivery mostly focuses on the optimization vehicle operations, the appropriate design of supportive infrastructures is seldom considered. This paper focuses on the energy efficiency of aerial logistic systems, and proposes a new original methodology to obtain a realistic estimate of the overall energy consumed by a swarm of drones employed for urban delivery, taking into account the extension of the area served and its specific features. The methodology proposed offers relevant information for the decision problems related to the appropriate sizing of the infrastructures, the dimensioning of the swarm of drones and the capacity of the energy storage system.

In light of these phenomena, there is a clear need for intelligent management of urban space using new technologies that would be complementary to existing intelligent transportation systems. Expanding information resources obtained from mobile cameras will have a positive impact on increasing the efficiency of transportation management and use of limited space in city centers.

Abstract: The advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology in terms of industrial processes and communication and networking technologies has led to an increase in their use in civil, business, and social applications. Global rules in most countries had previously limited the use of drones to military applications due to their deployment in the open air, drones are likely to be lost, destroyed, or physically hijacked. However, more recently, the presence of COVID-19 has forced the world to present new implementing measures which will also widen the use of drones in civil and commercial and social applications, especially now in the delivery of medicines for medical home care. In the period of required public isolation as a consequence of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, this knowledge has become one of the principal partners in the fight against the coronavirus. This paper offers a summary of the medical drone manufacturing, with a specific emphasis on its approval by the pharmaceutical sector to solve logistical problems in healthcare during times of sensitive need. We also discuss the numerous challenges to be met in the integration of drones to save our lives and suggest future research directions. The question that arises for this problem, how to optimize delivery medical supplies times in-home health care made up of drones? We conducted a synthesis literature review devoted to the use of UAVs in healthcare with their different aspects. A total of different research made are given to describe the role of UAV in Home healthcare with the presence of SARS-COV-2. We conclude that the drones will be able to optimize the way of eliminating contamination with a very high percentage (through the reduction of human contact) with the increase of the flexibility of the flight (reaching the less accessible regions every hour of the day).

To address these challenges, it is necessary to detect potential threats by analyzing the encrypted Wi-Fi traffic data generated by UAVs. This study aimed to develop a linear SVM model that is enhanced with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques and fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization for intrusion detection systems (IDSs); the model is specifically designed to identify malware threats targeting UAVs.

SVM-based intrusion detection models have been modeled on these datasets, identified their key features using the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) technique, and conducted a cost analysis of the proposed modeling approach. The incorporation of the LIME method enabled to highlight the features that are highly indicative of cyberattacks and provided valuable insights into the importance of each feature in the context of intrusion detection.

As observations are expensive and logistically challenging, it is important to evaluate the benefit that additional observations could bring to NWP. Atmospheric soundings applying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a large potential to supplement conventional radiosonde sounding observations. Here, we applied UAV and radiosonde sounding observations from an RV Polarstern cruise in the ice-covered Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013 to evaluate the impact of their assimilation in the Polar version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (Polar WRF) model. Our experiments revealed small to moderate impacts of radiosonde and UAV data assimilation. In any case, the assimilation of sounding data from both radiosondes and UAVs improved the analyses of air temperature, wind speed, and humidity at the observation site for most of the time. Further, the impact on the results of 5-day-long Polar WRF experiments was often felt over distances of at least 300 km from the observation site. All experiments succeeded in capturing the main features of the evolution of near-surface variables, but the effects of data assimilation varied between different cases. Due to the limited vertical extent of the UAV observations, the impact of their assimilation was limited to the lowermost 1-2-km layer, and assimilation of radiosonde data was more beneficial for modeled sea level pressure and near-surface wind speed.

{"text": "Title: Trajectory Planning for Emergency Landing of VTOL Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Abstract: In recent years, inspired by technological progress and the outstanding performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in several local wars, the UAV industry has witnessed explosive development, widely used in communication relay, logistics, surveying and mapping, patrol, surveillance, and other fields. Vertical Take-Off and Landing fixed-wing UAV has both the advantages of vertical take-off and landing of rotorcraft and the advantages of long endurance of fixed-wing UAV, which broadened its application field and is the most popular UAV at present. Recently, fixed-wing UAV failure analysis highlights that cruise engine shutdown is the most common reason for emergency landing, which is also a governing factor for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) fixed-wing UAV failures. Nevertheless, the emergency landing trajectory of the latter UAV type after engine shutdown is different from that of the conventional fixed-wing UAVs due to the VTOL power system. Hence, spurred by the requirement of a safe emergency landing trajectory for VTOL fixed-wing UAVs, this paper develops an architecture capable of safe emergency landing for such platforms. The suggested method develops a particle dynamics model of the VTOL UAV and analyzes its aerodynamic characteristics utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. The UAV's trajectory is divided into three parts for enhanced planning. For the guidance stage, the initial position and heading angle are arbitrary. Hence, the Dubins shortest cross-range and the fastest descent trajectory are adopted to steer the UAV above the landing window quickly. The spiral stage comprises a conical and cylindrical part combined with a spiral descent trajectory of variable radius for energy management and landing course alignment. Given the limited energy storage of VTOL power systems, the landing stage exploits an optimal control trajectory problem solved by a Gaussian pseudospectral method, involving trajectory conventional landing planning, unpowered landing, distance optimal landing, and wind-resistant landing. All trajectories meet the dynamics constraints, terminal constraints, and sliding performance constraints and cover both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional trajectories. A large number of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed trajectories manage broad applicability and strong feasibility for VTOL fixed-wing UAVs. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: BVLOS UAV missions for vegetation mapping in maritime Antarctic Abstract: Polar areas are among the regions where climate change occurs faster than on most of the other areas on Earth. To study the effects of climate change on vegetation, there is a need for knowledge on its current status and properties. Both classic field observation methods and remote sensing methods based on manned aircraft or satellite image analysis have limitations. These include high logistic operation costs, limited research areas, high safety risks, direct human impact, and insufficient resolution of satellite images. Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle beyond the visual line of sight (UAV BVLOS) missions can bridge the scale gap between field-based observations and full-scale airborne or satellite surveys. In this study the two operations of the UAV BVLOS, at an altitude of 350 m ASL, have been successfully performed in Antarctic conditions. Maps of the vegetation of the western shore of Admiralty Bay (King George Island, South Shetlands, Western Antarctic) that included the Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 128 (ASPA 128) were designed. The vegetation in the 7.5 km(2) area was mapped in ultra-high resolution (<5 cm and DEM of 0.25 m GSD), and from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), four broad vegetation units were extracted: \"dense moss carpets\" (covering 0.14 km(2), 0.8% of ASPA 128), \"Sanionia uncinata moss bed\" (0.31 km(2), 1.7% of ASPA 128), \"Deschampsia antarctica grass meadow\" (0.24 km(2), 1.3% of ASPA 128), and \"Deschampsia antarctica-Usnea antarctica heath\" (1.66 km(2), 9.4% of ASPA 128). Our results demonstrate that the presented UAV BVLOS-based surveys are time-effective (single flight lasting 2.5 h on a distance of 300 km) and cost-effective when compared to classical field-based observations and are less invasive for the ecosystem. Moreover, unmanned airborne vehicles significantly improve security, which is of particular interest in polar region research.

Species differences in the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation can be used as a surrogate estimate plant biodiversity using multispectral image data. However, these efforts are often hampered by logistical difficulties in broad-scale implementation. Here, we investigate the utility of multispectral imaging technology from commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) in estimating biodiversity metrics at a fine spatial resolution (0.1-0.5 cm pixel resolution) in a temperate calcareous grassland in Oxfordshire, UK. We calculate a suite of moments (coefficient of variation, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) for the distribution of radiance from multispectral images at five wavelength bands (Blue 450 +/- 16 nm; Green 560 +/- 16 nm; Red 650 +/- 16 nm; Red Edge 730 +/- 16 nm; Near Infrared 840 +/- 16 nm) and test their effectiveness at estimating ground-truthed biodiversity metrics from in situ botanical surveys for 37-1 x 1 m quadrats. We find positive associations between the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance and both the Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's biodiversity indices. Furthermore, the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance is consistent and highly repeatable across sampling days and recording heights. Positive associations with biodiversity indices hold irrespective of the image recording height (2-8 m), but we report reductions in estimates of spectral diversity with increases to UAV recording height. UAV imaging reduced sampling time by a factor of 16 relative to in situ botanical surveys. We demonstrate the utility of multispectral radiance moments as an indicator of biodiversity in this temperate calcareous grassland at a fine spatial resolution using a widely available UAV monitoring system with a coarse spectral resolution.

We developed a low-cost multirotor UAV incorporating a sterile petri dish with a remotely operated 'blow' to sample whale blow with minimal disturbance to the whales. This design addressed several sampling challenges: accessibility; safety; cost, and critically, minimized the collection of atmospheric and seawater microbiota and other potential sources of sample contamination. We collected 59 samples of blow from northward migrating humpback whales off Sydney, Australia and used high throughput sequencing of bacterial ribosomal gene markers to identify putative respiratory tract microbiota. Model-based comparisons with seawater and drone-captured air demonstrated that our system minimized external sources of contamination and successfully captured sufficient material to identify whale blow-specific microbial taxa. Whale-specific taxa included species and genera previously associated with the respiratory tracts or oral cavities of mammals (e.g., Pseudomonas, Clostridia, Cardiobacterium), as well as species previously isolated from dolphin or killer whale blowholes (Corynebacteria, others). Many examples of exogenous marine species were identified, including Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. that have been associated with the skin microbiota of marine mammals and fish and may include pathogens.

The UAV takes off from the depot, completes the pickup and delivery tasks, and returns to the depot; it needs to maintain a reliable connection with the ground base station (GBS) during the UAV's flight. In the mission, the energy consumption of the UAV is closely related to the order of pickup and delivery as well as the weight of the goods. Therefore, this paper achieves the goal of minimizing UAV energy consumption and designing UAV flight trajectory by optimizing the access sequence. In this paper, we first construct a radio map of the target area, and then we propose an improved Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the path which is the shortest between any two access points that satisfies reliable communication. Then, using the constructed distance matrix, we use a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to solve the UAV trajectory of the minimum energy pickup and delivery problem (PDP).

However, with the establishment of the newly independent states in the 1990s, many of the former uranium mining and processing facilities and their associated wastes (dumps and tailings) were abandoned and have since posed a threat to the environment. The fact that the sites were left behind without proper remediation for a long time has led to the uncontrolled spread of radioactive and toxic contaminants in the environment due to landslides or flooding. Knowledge of the exact location of some waste facilities was lost as a result of social disruptions during the 1990s. In order to assess radiological risks and plan and implement adequate, sustainable, and environmental remediation measures, the radiological situation at the uranium legacy sites must be repeatedly mapped with the best possible accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this paper, we present the experimental use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with gamma spectrometry systems as a novel tool for mapping, assessing, and monitoring radioactivity at sites affected by uranium mining and processing and other activities related to enhanced natural radioactivity. Special emphasis is put on the practical conditions of using UAV-based gamma spectrometry in an international context focusing on low- and medium-income countries. Challenges and opportunities of this technology are discussed, and its reliability and robustness under field conditions are critically reviewed. The most promising future application of the technology appears to be the radiological monitoring, institutional control, and quality assurance of legacy sites during and after environmental remediation.

Four remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) were fielded in Minamisanriku and Rikuzentakata from April 18 to 24, 2011, for port clearing and victim recovery missions using sonar and video. The ROVs were used for multirobot operations only 46% of the time due to logistics. The teleoperated ROVs functioned as a dependent team 86% of the time to avoid sensor interference or collisions. The deployment successfully reopened the Minamisanriku New Port area and searched areas prohibited to divers in Rikuzentakata. The IRS-CRASAR team planned to return from October 18 to 28, 2011, with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and an ROV to conduct debris mapping for environmental remediation missions. The intent was to investigate an interdependent strategy by which the UAV and AUV would rapidly conduct low-resolution scans identifying areas of interest for further investigation by the ROV. The UAV and AUV could not be used; however, the ROV was able to cover 80,000 m2 in 6 h, finding submerged wreckage and pollutants in areas previously marked clear by divers. The field work (i) showed that the actual and planned multirobot system configurations did not fall neatly into traditional taxonomies, (ii) identified a new measure, namely perceptual confidence, and (iii) posed five open research questions for multirobot systems operating in littoral regions.

{"text": "Title: Adaptive Control Design for Multi-UAV Cooperative Lift Systems Abstract: Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative lift systems use multiple UAVs to collectively lift and transport payloads. These systems have unique benefits over standard single-vehicle logistics paradigms in that they distribute lift capacity among several potentially inexpensive and man-portable aircraft, and furthermore provide redundancy to guard against vehicle failure. However, several challenges arise when multiple vehicles are tasked with coordinating stabilization and control tasks for an unknown payload, particularly when there is also uncertainty regarding relative vehicle placement and orientation. This paper presents a novel adaptive control framework for modular cooperative lift systems. The algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter to update system parameters within a control allocation scheme. Thrust vectoring is employed to ensure adequate yaw control authority, and null-space excitation is used to speed estimator convergence. The adaptive control approach is designed to execute a full payload transportation mission starting from rest on the ground. Extensive simulation studies and preliminary flight experiments evaluate robustness of the adaptive control scheme and explore tradeoffs with respect to several system parameters and levels of uncertainty. Overall, the proposed control and estimator scheme is shown to be highly effective in stabilizing multi-UAV payload systems under realistic uncertainty in vehicle configuration and payload parameters.

{"text": "Title: An unmanned aerial vehicle sampling platform for atmospheric water vapor isotopes in polar environments Abstract: Above polar ice sheets, atmospheric water vapor exchange occurs across the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and is an important mechanism in a number of processes that affect the surface mass balance of the ice sheets. Yet, this exchange is not well understood and has substantial implications for modeling and remote sensing of the polar hydrologic cycle. Efforts to characterize the exchange face substantial logistical challenges including the remoteness of ice sheet field camps, extreme weather conditions, low humidity and temperature that limit the effectiveness of instruments, and dangers associated with flying manned aircraft at low altitudes. Here, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sampling platform for operation in extreme polar environments that is capable of sampling atmospheric water vapor for subsequent measurement of water isotopes. This system was deployed to the East Greenland Ice-core Project (East-GRIP) camp in northeast Greenland during summer 2019. Four sampling flight missions were completed. With a suite of atmospheric measurements aboard the UAV (temperature, humidity, pressure, GPS) we determine the height of the PBL using online algorithms, allowing for strategic decision-making by the pilot to sample water isotopes above and below the PBL. Water isotope data were measured by a Picarro L2130-i instrument using flasks of atmospheric air collected within the nose cone of the UAV. The internal repeatability for delta D and delta O-18 was 2.8 parts per thousand and 0.45 parts per thousand, respectively, which we also compared to independent EastGRIP tower-isotope data. Based on these results, we demonstrate the efficacy of this new UAV-isotope platform and present improvements to be utilized in future polar field campaigns. The system is also designed to be readily adaptable to other fields of study, such as measurement of carbon cycle gases or remote sensing of ground conditions. ", "label": "False"}

Here, we tested photogrammetry methods using small aerial drones for accurate morphometric measurements of Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) body size and body condition. We flew drones to collect aerial imagery of captive manatees in Quintana Roo, Mexico and compared manatee body size measurements from scaled aerial imagery with physically measured body sizes. To assess optimal altitude for imaging, body size measurements acquired with an out-of-the-box drone were compared to measurements from the same drone model equipped with a LiDAR for precision altimetry flown at three altitudes (30 m, 50 m, 70 m). The accuracy of body size measures was similar for all drone models but improved with the addition of LiDAR. Difference in body size estimates between manual and drone-based measurements indicate a correction factor may be needed to account for disparities. We then used body size measurements to develop a body condition index for Antillean manatees.

{"text": "Title: Drone-Based Material Transfer System in a Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Center Abstract: Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, for final-mile delivery in logistics operations has inspired this research. One conceivable scenario is to use the drone to transfer jobs in a robotic mobile fulfillment center. Each job might be characterized by origin, destination, time window, and precedence relation. In particular, a take-away conveyor is continuously pushing forward shipping cartons, wherein drones must pick up jobs and drop them off to the cartons within the time window since the cartons would be closed and labeled at the end of the conveyor. Furthermore, each job contains two subtransfers for drone: flight from drone's current location to pickup location and flight to dropoff location. Two exact approaches are proposed-a mixed integer programming and a constraint programming-and tested for a real-time perspective. Note to Practitioners-Inspired by Amazon's significant expansion of its army of warehouse robots and the adaptation of drones for final-mile small parcel delivery, this article has mixed those two emerging technologies and proposed a drone-powered material transfer system in a warehouse, wherein jobs would be picked up by drone, transferred, and dropped off directly to shipping cartons.

The so-called U-space concept announced by the European Commission is one of the approaches to achieve that goal. There is also known concept of Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) - a tool which would enable the services needed for safe conduct of UAV flights in generally accessible airspace. There are quite a few European projects which focuses on testing UTM capabilities in order to find a solution which could enable the market and ensure safe UAV operations. One of those systems is PansaUTM - which was developed in order to coordinate drone flights in different types of airspace in Poland. The first part of the paper will present an example of the implementation of this system as a foundation for new possible applications of drones and increasing number of operations. The conclusion of the first part of the article is that, in line rapid growth of UAS flights and different applications of drone services, the European drone ecosystem should evolve even further to deploy very complex drone operations in scalable manner. In order to accommodate unmanned air taxi operations, cargo flights, medical cargo flights, automatic surveillance flights, etc. Europe is preparing towards deployment of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM).

At the same time, it should be stressed out that the medical transport using drones can be used in urgent situations, where the main variable that has an impact on the success of life and health saving is the breaking of barriers to reaching difficult-to-reach places. In addition, the development of transport using drones can have a lasting impact on improving the quality of life of chronically ill patients who experience severe disease recurrence and thus on the need to implement emergency prevention or treatment measures. The second part of the article focuses as well on the U-space concept as an opportunity for UAVs to be widely used in the field of day-to-day supplies as well as health-related supplies. In the context of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, drones may be used to provide diagnostic screening tests, medicinal products and septic materials, transport of samples of biological material, as well as an information campaign on how to deal with an epidemic, quarantine or isolation at home. The use of UAV for medical supplies is economically and legally justified. The U-space environment from the operational and regulatory side is a multidisciplinary approach that requires the interaction of aviation, law, medicine, robotics, mechatronics and engineering experts. The legal framework for the development of U-space should be taken into account, as well as sector-specific regulations taking into account the principles of the use of drones in strictly defined areas, including in the process of medical supply, and liability for damage caused by UAV medical supply or AI-controlled intelligent machines.

The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models for UAV-routing and UAV-route scheduling problems are proposed considering the effect of incidental processes and the varying payload on travel time. A hybrid genetic and simulated annealing (HGSA) algorithm is proposed for the UAV-routing problem to minimize travel time. In HGSA, genetic algorithm (GA) employs a novel stochastic crossover operator to search for the optimal global position of customers, whereas simulated annealing (SA) utilizes local search operators to avoid the local optima. A UAV-Oriented MinMin (UO-MinMin) algorithm is also proposed to minimize the makespan of the UAV-route scheduling problem. It employs a UAV-oriented view to generate the route -scheduling order with minimal computational efforts without affecting the quality of the makespan. A Monte Carlo simulation-based sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of the hybridization probability of GA and SA in the proposed HGSA algorithm. To assess the performance of the HGSA algorithm, a set P of 24 benchmark instances is adopted and adjusted to meet the constraints of the UAV-Assisted delivery system. The proposed HGSA outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization & Simulated Annealing algorithm (PSO-SA), Differential Evolution & Simulated Annealing (DE-SA), and Harris-hawks optimization (HHO).

{"text": "Title: Cooperative Path Optimization for Multiple UAVs Surveillance in Uncertain Environment Abstract: Research on multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cooperative surveillance systems serving Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smart cities, precision logistics, etc., has become a hot topic. However, the target movement is unpredictable in an uncertain environment, and multiple UAVs are affected by obstacles or inaccessible regions, resulting in the decreased surveillance performance and even the loss of the target. This article is dedicated to determine the current surveillance environment through the 2-D laser scanner. At the cost of the energy consumption and the transmission unreliability, a multi-UAV cooperative path optimization (MCPO) model is designed to adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which improves the target surveillance performance. Specifically, for different types of obstacles or inaccessible regions, we present a novel obstacle-avoidance selection strategy with two mechanisms in mind: 1) when some of UAVs encounter obstacles, but others can accurately monitor the target, a strict constraint mechanism is established to promptly adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which ensures the accuracy of formation surveillance and 2) when all UAVs have to avoid obstacles, a fuzzy constraint mechanism is presented and combined with Lucas-Kanade (LK) method to expand the search range of the multi-UAV and enhance the flexible adjustment capability of the formation. To verify the superiority of the proposed optimization method, we develop a 3-D simulation experiment environment based on the UE4 platform and design several groups of experiments to analyze the effectiveness of MCPO. The experimental results demonstrate that MCPO can not only maintain the flight stability of multiple UAVs but also has satisfactory formation flexibility and surveillance accuracy.

Nevertheless, the existing research on logistics UAV path planning lacks to simultaneously consider the UAV energy consumption constraints, the customer time windows, the impacts of wind speed and direction. This omission renders the existing models inappropriate for real-world transportation systems. Besides, the UAVs are still constrained by the limited payload and battery due to the highly automatic delivery process. Consequently, we investigate the effect of wind speed and direction on UAV flight states, establishes pertinent parameters and their resolution methods impacted by wind conditions, and delves into the logistics UAV path planning issue that concurrently considers the UAV energy consumption constraints, the customer time windows, and the impact of wind conditions. To resolve the proposed trajectory optimization issue, the large-scale neighborhood search algorithm (LNS) is amalgamated with the genetic algorithm (GA), forming the GA-LNS, to address the static problem, while dynamic planning concepts are employed in the decoding process of GA-LNS to solve the dynamic trajectory optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the devised algorithms yield superior solutions within a plausible timeframe, reducing distribution costs by approximately 9% in comparison to the conventional GA. Unlike the no-wind and static scenarios, path planning that incorporates dynamic wind conditions circumvents issues related to energy constraints and customer satisfaction bias evident in the prior cases.

Estimates or direct counts from UAV images were not significantly different from a known number of decoys or ground counts for Great Egrets but were almost twice as high compared to ground counts for juvenile Brown Pelicans. UAV flights did not cause either Great Egrets or Brown Pelicans to flush from nesting areas while ground surveys flushed the majority of adult Brown Pelicans from the survey area.

The increasing availability of high-resolution topography data generated by low-cost Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and modern photogrammetry offer an opportunity to identify and characterize these features. In this paper, we assessed the capabilities of UAS-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, coupled with a river terrace detection algorithm for mapping of river terraces over a 1.9 km(2) valley of complex terrain setting, with a focus on the performance of this latest technology over such complex terrains. With the proposed image acquisition approach and SfM photogrammetry, we constructed a 3.8 cm resolution orthomosaic and digital surface model (DSM). The vertical accuracy of DSM was assessed against 196 independent checkpoints measured with a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS. The results indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 3.1cm and 2.9 cm, respectively. These encouraging results suggest that this low-cost, logistically simple method can deliver high-quality terrain datasets even in the complex terrain, competitive with those obtained using more expensive laser scanning. A simple algorithm was then employed to detect river terraces from the generated DSM. The results showed that three levels of river terraces and a high-level floodplain were identified. Most of the detected river terraces were confirmed by field observations. Despite the highly erosive nature of fluvial systems, this work obtained good results, allowing fast analysis of fluvial valleys and their comparison.

Computational analysis was performed to provide insight into the catalyst behavior. Analytical studies suggested increased stability due to both heat release due to exothermic catalytic reaction and production of reactive species. This technology would allow high power density engines to use heavy fuels, while potentially reducing electric power supply and engine complexity and weight, both of which would allow greater range and/or payload capacity. This paper discusses the feasibility of advanced igniters technology as an enabling component for the use of heavy fuels in small, high power density internal combustion engines. The paper presents and discusses analytical investigation, experimental test results, and durability testing data in an internal combustion engine environment. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: A decision support system for coordinated disaster relief distribution Abstract: This paper presents a simulation and optimization based decision-support system (DSS) to facilitate disaster relief coordination between private and relief organizations. The DSS simulates disasters and plans shipments of relief goods via transfer points to demand points in the affected area. This enables decision makers to analyze the last-mile distribution of goods by scheduling and routing trucks, off-road as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. Roads which are closed or opened during a disaster are considered allowing a dynamic adaptation to real world conditions and a comprehensive analysis over a rolling time-horizon. A mixed-integer problem formulation, an agent-based simulation, a heuristic-based scheduling and routing procedure as well as a Tabu Search metaheuristic are applied to analyze the given decision problem. Coordination between private and relief organization shows to be especially beneficial if time-losses resulting from closed roads are high and substantial unexpected demand occurs. Furthermore, results highlight the importance of selecting suitable transfer points and the potential of simulation and optimization based DSSs to improve disaster relief distribution.

{"text": "Title: Predicting Biomass and Yield in a Tomato Phenotyping Experiment Using UAV Imagery and Random Forest Abstract: Biomass and yield are key variables for assessing the production and performance of agricultural systems. Modeling and predicting the biomass and yield of individual plants at the farm scale represents a major challenge in precision agriculture, particularly when salinity and other abiotic stresses may play a role. Here, we evaluate a diversity panel of the wild tomato species (Solanum pimpinellifolium) through both field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based phenotyping of 600 control and 600 salt-treated plants. The study objective was to predict fresh shoot mass, tomato fruit numbers, and yield mass at harvest based on a range of variables derived from the UAV imagery. UAV-based red-green-blue (RGB) imageries collected 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks before harvest were also used to determine if prediction accuracies varied between control and salt-treated plants. Multispectral UAV-based imagery was also collected 1 and 2 weeks prior to harvest to further explore predictive insights. In order to estimate the end of season biomass and yield, a random forest machine learning approach was implemented using UAV-imagery-derived predictors as input variables. Shape features derived from the UAV, such as plant area, border length, width, and length, were found to have the highest importance in the predictions, followed by vegetation indices and the entropy texture measure. The multispectral UAV imagery collected 2 weeks prior to harvest produced the highest explained variances for fresh shoot mass (87.95%), fruit numbers (63.88%), and yield mass per plant (66.51%). The RGB UAV imagery produced very similar results to those of the multispectral UAV dataset, with the explained variance reducing as a function of increasing time to harvest. The results showed that predicting the yield of salt-stressed plants produced higher accuracies when the models excluded control plants, whereas predicting the yield of control plants was not affected by the inclusion of salt-stressed plants within the models. This research demonstrates that it is possible to predict the average biomass and yield up to 8 weeks prior to harvest within 4.23% of field-based measurements and up to 4 weeks prior to harvest at the individual plant level. Results from this work may be useful in providing guidance for yield forecasting of healthy and salt-stressed tomato plants, which in turn may inform growing practices, logistical planning, and sales operations.

{"text": "Title: Dynamic Order Picking Method for Multi-UAV System in Intelligent Warehouse Abstract: For the logistics environment, multi-UAV algorithms have been studied for the purpose of order picking in warehouses. However, modern order picking adopts static order picking methods that struggle to cope with increasing volumes of goods because the algorithms receive orders for a certain period of time and pick only those orders. In this paper, by using the modified interventionist method and dynamic path planning, we aim to assign orders received in real-time to multi-UAVs in the warehouse, and to determine the order picking sequence and path of each UAV. The halting and correcting strategy is proposed to assign orders to UAVs in consideration of the similarity between the UAV's picking list and the orders. A UAV starts picking orders by using the ant colony optimization algorithm for the orders initially assigned. For additional orders, the UAV modifies the picking sequence and UAV's path in real time by using the k-opt-based algorithm. We evaluated the proposed method by changing the parameters in a simulation of a general warehouse layout. The results show that the proposed method not only reduces completion time compared to the previous algorithm but also reduces UAV's travel distance and the collapsed time. ", "label": "True"}

However, autopilot systems fail to navigate due to lost or jammed GNSS signal. To solve this problem, information from other sensors such as optical sensors are used. Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been developed over the last few years and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., visual SLAM algorithms achieve centimeter-level precision in an in-doors environment). Also, map matching localization approaches are used for UAV localization relatively to imagery from static maps such as Google Maps. Unfortunately, the accuracy and robustness of these algorithms are very dependent on up-to-date maps. The purpose of this research is to improve the accuracy and robustness of map-relative particle filter-based localization using a downward-facing optical camera mounted on an autonomous aircraft.

Addressing the need for improved logistics operations during such crises, this article presents an innovative approach, namely integrating vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) logistics to enhance the efficiency and resilience of medical supply chains. Our study introduces a dual-mode distribution framework which employs the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for efficiently clustering demand zones unreachable by conventional vehicles, thereby identifying areas requiring UAV delivery. Furthermore, we categorize the demand for medical supplies into two distinct sets based on vehicle accessibility, optimizing distribution routes via both UAVs and vehicles. Through comparative analysis, our findings reveal that the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm significantly outperforms the genetic algorithm in terms of solving efficiency, iteration counts, and delivery speed. However, the ABC algorithm's tendency toward early local optimization and rapid convergence leads to potential stagnation in local optima. To mitigate this issue, we incorporate a simulated annealing technique into the ABC framework, culminating in a refined optimization approach which successfully overcomes the limitations of premature local optima convergence. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our enhanced algorithm, demonstrating reduced iteration counts, shorter computation times, and substantially improved solution quality over traditional logistic models.

This may be accomplished by handing off the mission tasks to fully fueled replacement UAVs when the current fleet grows weary. The drained UAVs then seek replenishment from nearby logistics support facilities. To support the vision of a persistent fleet of UAVs pursuing missions across a field of operations, we develop an improved mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that can serve to support the system's efforts to orchestrate the operations of numerous UAVs, missions and logistics facilities.

This study develops a comprehensive mathematical model to optimize such systems, addressing key challenges such as UAV limitations (short range, cargo weight, and energy constraints) and the influence of weather conditions (wind speed, wind direction, and temperature).

{"text": "Title: A reliable unmanned aerial vehicle multi-ship tracking method Abstract: As the global economy expands, waterway transportation has become increasingly crucial to the logistics sector. This growth presents both significant challenges and opportunities for enhancing the accuracy of ship detection and tracking through the application of artificial intelligence. This article introduces a multi-object tracking system designed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), utilizing the YOLOv7 and Deep SORT algorithms for detection and tracking, respectively. To mitigate the impact of limited ship data on model training, transfer learning techniques are employed to enhance the YOLOv7 model's performance. Additionally, the integration of the SimAM attention mechanism within the YOLOv7 detection model improves feature representation by emphasizing salient features and suppressing irrelevant information, thereby boosting detection capabilities. The inclusion of the partial convolution (PConv) module further enhances the detection of irregularly shaped or partially occluded targets. This module minimizes the influence of invalid regions during feature extraction, resulting in more accurate and stable features. The implementation of PConv not only improves detection accuracy and speed but also reduces the model's parameters and computational demands, making it more suitable for deployment on computationally constrained UAV platforms. Furthermore, to address issues of false negatives during clustering in the Deep SORT algorithm, the IOU metric is replaced with the DIOU metric at the matching stage. This adjustment enhances the matching of unlinked tracks with detected objects, reducing missed detections and improving the accuracy of target tracking. Compared to the original YOLOv7+Deep SORT model, which achieved an MOTA of 58.4% and an MOTP of 78.9%, the enhanced system achieves a MOTA of 65.3% and a MOTP of 81.9%.

{"text": "Title: Finite-Time Robust Flight Control of Logistic Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using a Time-Delay Estimation Technique Abstract: This paper proposes a cascaded dual closed-loop control strategy that incorporates time delay estimation and sliding mode control (SMC) to address the issue of uncertain disturbances in logistic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) caused by ground effects, crosswind disturbances, and payloads. The control strategy comprises a position loop and an attitude loop. The position loop, which functions as the outer loop, employs a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) sliding mode surface to eliminate steady-state error through an integral component. Conversely, the attitude loop, serving as the inner loop, utilizes a fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode approach to achieve finite-time convergence and ensure a quick system response. The time-delay estimation technique is employed for the online estimation and real-time compensation of unknown disturbances, while SMC is used to enhance the robustness of the control system. The combination of time-delay estimation and SMC offers complementary advantages. The stability of the system is proven using Lyapunov theory. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation and flight tests demonstrate that the control law can achieve a smooth and continuous output. The proposed control strategy can be effectively applied in complex scenarios, such as hovering, crash recovery, and high maneuverability flying, with significant practicality in engineering applications.

{"text": "Title: Drone routing problem with truck: Optimization and quantitative analysis Abstract: Battery-powered drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer significant market potential, enabling fast, cost-effective, and eco-friendly delivery on an urban scale. Numerous corporations are investing in initiatives to explore drone logistics capabilities. However, drones' limited delivery range due to their inherent battery ca-pacity constraints remains a challenge. To address this issue, the hybrid delivery system, combining trucks and drones, has emerged as a promising solution and has been the focus of recent studies. Most prior research as-sumes that trucks park at customer locations while drones make auxiliary deliveries, but this approach can limit drone efficiency by restricting flights to customer sites, which may not always be the most suitable parking spots. A recent study proposed a new variation of the truck-drone delivery system, the Drone Routing Problem with Truck (DRP-T), which uses drones as the primary delivery system and features launch locations separate from customer sites (Jeong and Lee, 2021). DRP-T has demonstrated superior delivery capabilities, albeit with increased problem complexity. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of establishing parking locations by comparing scenarios with customer location launching to further examine DRP-T's delivery capabilities. Addi-tionally, we compare DRP-T to the well-known single truck, multi-drone model to further investigate DRP-T's potential. To mitigate DRP-T's complexity, we propose a computationally efficient heuristic algorithm. Nu-merical experiments quantitatively demonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness and reveal substantial savings with DRP-T. Moreover, we present a sensitivity analysis to support economic decision-making in various operational environments. ", "label": "True"}

Although control, navigation, and communication technologies are becoming available on individual flight units, system-level motion management for dense UAS traffic remains an open question. This paper presents a motion-planning model based on nonlinear optimization techniques to centrally coordinate paths for all vehicles traversing a shared two-dimensional (2D) space. An exact bound is derived to characterize the discrete-time separation constraints, and a set of new metrics is proposed to measure 2D traffic flow efficiency. The grand goal is to make all vehicles that come under dispatch reach their respective destinations quickly and efficiently while maintaining a safe intervehicle separation at all times. This infinite-horizon operational problem is formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex optimization model that must be solved in a progressive, receding-horizon fashion. To ensure feasibility and overcome path deadlocks attributed to local optima, a series of heuristic measures are developed. By pivoting on artfully coined intermediate feasibility, the algorithm is able to circumvent imminent deadlocks in a predictive manner and progressively construct the solution with guaranteed feasibility.

With efficient algorithms for UAV task planning, the UAVs can autonomously serve the customers in real time. Nearly uninterrupted customer service may be accomplished via the cooperative hand-off of customer tasks from weary UAVs to ones that have recently been replenished at an LSS. With the goal of enabling the autonomy of the task planning tasks, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem of providing simultaneous. UAV escort service to multiple customers across a field of operations with multiple sharable LSSs. This MILP model provides a formal representation of our problem and enables use in a rolling horizon planner via allowance of arbitrary UAV initial locations and consumable reservoir status (e.g., battery level). As such, it enables automation of the orchestration of system activities. To address computational complexity, we develop efficient heuristics to rapidly derive near optimal solutions. A receding horizon task assignment (RHTA) heuristic and sequential task assignment heuristic (STAH) are developed. STAH exploits properties observed in optimal solutions obtained for small problems via CPLEX.

Technological advances such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based logistics systems have thus emerged as promising solutions in urban environments and are increasingly being piloted worldwide. However, the implementation of UAV logistics risks exacerbating social inequities, particularly in marginalized communities that may disproportionately bear the noise and safety risks. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to integrate social equity considerations into urban UAV logistics. This study explores social equity factors through a systematic literature review and social media analysis of Xiaohongshu (the Little Red Book), a popular Chinese social media platform known for its extensive user base and active discussions on social issues. This literature review involves a full-text examination, while latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is used to analyze social media comment datasets. Each method identifies social equity factors and separately assesses their relative importance, resulting in the final identification of 24 key factors that provide a holistic view of public sentiment and academic discourse.

{"text": "Title: Coordinated routing system for fire detection by patrolling trucks with drones Abstract: Vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is an extension of classical vehicle routing, which involves the usage of trucks and drones. Nowadays, bushfires are taken into account as a major global challenging subject. Indeed, forests are very vulnerable to fires, and the classical patrol systems cannot patrol all areas of the forest and pastures due to the difficult crossing of some routes. The literature survey demonstrated that the mathematical models are an efficient approach for planning forest and rangeland patrols. Drones and trucks are used in cooperation for forest monitoring in this study, with drones acting as an efficient and accurate means of monitoring routes that are impassable to ground vehicles. However, this novel approach deals with several substantial challenges, including limitation in the drone's battery and the routing problem in an integrated truck-drone system based on considering hard-to-reach areas and creating a trade-off between time and cost of the patrol process. These issues make significant differences between the proposed novel approach and the classical vehicle routing problem. Thus, it is essential to develop a comprehensive approach to resolve these crucial issues. The present study develops a multi objective mathematical programming model as mixed-integer programming for simultaneous patrolling of trucks and drones. The augmented epsilon constraint (AEC) method has been considered to solve the two-objective mathematical programming model. Besides, Benders' decomposition (BD) algorithm has been employed to evaluate the achieved results in large-size problems. The performance of the BD algorithm has been confirmed in this study. The findings indicated that the proposed model efficiently protected the forest via monitoring all areas, including impassable areas where ground patrolling is impossible (e.g., the lack of roads due to dense vegetation). Also, it was proved that this system was a novel, cost-effective patrol, which prevents uncontrollable fires in the shortest possible time. ", "label": "True"}

Moreover, it provides a competitive edge in the field of logistics while decreasing costs and improving stock management efficiency. Deployment of autonomous UAVs in an indoor environment puts higher requirements for the level of autonomy due to the more complex nature of the environment (narrow crossings, absence of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), smaller manoeuvring space, dynamic environment, etc. ...).

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use framework of the inspection task that any warehouse operator is capable of using it. The system consists of two main parts -user interface and path planner. Using a created human -machine interface (HMI), an operator is able to define the workspace and the inspection task. The path planning module takes as an input the definition of the inspection task defined by the operator and plans an optimised collision-less path.

This paper considers the lastmile delivery system in which a fleet of homogeneous EVs, equipped with a UAV each, serve a set of customers, and meanwhile battery swapping vehicles (BSVs) offer mobile battery swapping service for EVs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to minimize the sum of depreciation cost, driver wages and energy consumption cost of EVs, UAVs, and BSVs, by considering the nonlinear energy consumption of each vehicle, time-dependent speeds of EVs and BSVs and monetary time value on depreciation cost.

While the truck follows a multi-stop route, each UAV delivers a single shipment per dispatch. The presented optimization model minimizes the waiting time of customers in the system. The model determines the optimal allocation of customers to truck and UAVs, the optimal route sequence of the truck, and the optimal launch and reconvene locations of the UAVs along the truck route.

Identifying interactions and patterns among these three variables represents an important first step to determining best survey practices. We used a drone to survey known numbers of eight animal decoy species, representing a range of body sizes and colors, at four ground sampling distance (GSD) values (0.35, 0.70, 1.06, and 1.41 cm/pixel) representing equivalent flight altitudes (15.2, 30.5, 45.7, and 61.0 m) at two camera angles (45 degrees and 90 degrees) and across a range of times of day (morning to late afternoon). Expert human observers identified and counted animals from drone images to determine how the three controllable factors affected accuracy and precision. Observer precision was high and unaffected by tested factors. However, results for observer accuracy revealed an interaction among all three controllable factors. Increasing flight altitude resulted in decreased accuracy in animal counts overall; however, accuracy was best at midday than during the morning and afternoon, when decoy and structure shadows were present or more pronounced. Surprisingly, the 45 degrees camera enhanced accuracy more than the 90 degrees camera, but only when animals were most difficult to identify and count, such as at higher flight altitudes or during the early morning and late afternoon.

This paper presents a model based on stochastic Petri nets (SPN) for evaluating the operational efficiency of drone delivery systems, with an emphasis on the completion times for tasks executed by either individual or multiple collaborating drones. Recognizing the limitation of drones' operational duration, chiefly hindered by battery life, the paper suggests the creation of strategic charging stations and the adoption of cooperative delivery tactics as potential solutions, albeit with inherent costs. Two SPN models were developed within this study: one depicting solo drone missions and another depicting cooperative missions with package transfers between drones. These models facilitate the examination of several performance indicators, such as Utilization Level, Mean Mission Time, Delivery Rate, and the probability of delivering a set number of packages within a designated period. By utilizing Design of Experiments (DoE) methods for sensitivity analysis, the study pinpoints essential factors that impact the performance of deliveries and offers strategies for the enhancement of drone delivery networks. The paper concludes by asserting that strategic placement of charging stations coupled with collaborative delivery efforts can effectively mitigate the limitations posed by drones' battery life, thereby augmenting the overall efficacy and feasibility of drone-based delivery services. The SPN models provide a robust predictive framework for drone delivery performance, aiding in improved planning and allocation of resources. The findings underscore the advantages of cooperative drone operations in urban logistics and call for additional research on the optimization of charging station placement and the refinement of collaborative drone strategies.

Acting as a crucial link segment of the SAGIN, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-satellite communication has drawn much attention. However, it is a key challenge to track dynamic channel information due to the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite orbiting and three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectory. In this paper, we explore the 3D channel tracking for a Ka-band UAV-satellite communication system. We firstly propose a statistical dynamic channel model called 3D two-dimensional Markov model (3D-2D-MM) for the UAV-satellite communication system by exploiting the probabilistic insight relationship of both hidden value vector and joint hidden support vector. Specifically, for the joint hidden support vector, we consider a more realistic 3D support vector in both azimuth and elevation direction. Moreover, the spatial sparsity structure and the time-varying probabilistic relationship between degree patterns named the spatial and temporal correlation, respectively, are studied for each direction. Furthermore, we derive a novel 3D dynamic turbo approximate message passing (3D-DTAMP) algorithm to recursively track the dynamic channel with the 3D-2D-MM priors. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm achieves superior channel tracking performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms with lower pilot overhead and comparable complexity.

{"text": "Title: Reinforcement learning for humanitarian relief distribution with trucks and UAVs under travel time uncertainty Abstract: Effective humanitarian relief operations are challenging in the aftermath of disasters, as trucks are often faced with considerable travel time uncertainties due to damaged transportation networks. Efficient deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) potentially mitigates this problem, supplementing truck fleets in an impactful manner. To plan last-mile relief distribution in this setting, we introduce a multi-trip, split-delivery vehicle routing problem with trucks and UAVs, soft time windows, and stochastic travel times for last-mile relief distribution, formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. Within a finite time horizon, we aim to maximize a weighted objective function comprising the number of goods delivered, the number of different locations visited, and late arrival penalties. Our study offers insights into dealing with travel time uncertainty in humanitarian logistics by (i) deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as partial substitutes for trucks, (ii) evaluating dynamic solutions generated by two deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches - specifically value function approximation (VFA) and policy function approximation (PFA) - and (iii) comparing the RL solutions with solutions stemming from mathematical programming and dynamic heuristics. Experiments are performed on both Solomon-based instances and two real-world cases. The real-world cases - the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the 2018 Indonesia tsunami - are based on locally collected field data and real-world UAV specifications, and aim to provide practical insights. The experimental results show that dynamic decision-making improves both performance and robustness of humanitarian operations, achieving reductions in lateness penalties of around 85% compared to static solutions based on expected travel times. Furthermore, the results show that replacing half of the trucks with UAVs improves the weighted objective value by 11% to 56%, benefitting both reliability and location coverage. The results indicate that both the deployment of UAVs and the use of dynamic methods successfully mitigate travel time uncertainties in humanitarian operations. ", "label": "True"}

{"text": "Title: Model of the LOS Probability for the UAV Channel and Its Application for Environment Awareness Abstract: Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in many applications, such as in transportation logistics, public safety, or even in non-terrestrial networks (NTN). In all these scenarios, it is an important issue to model channel behavior between the UAV and the user equipment (UE) on the ground. Among these channel features, a critical parameter that dominates channel behavior is the probability of the line-of-sight (LOS), since the statistical property of the channel fading can be either Ricean or Rayleigh, depending on the existence of LOS. Besides, with knowledge of LOS probability, operators can design approaches or schemes to maximum system performance, such as the serving coverage, received signal to noise ratio (SNR), or the bit error rate (BER) with the limited transmitted power. However, the LOS UAV channel is likely difficult to acquire or derive, as it depends on the deployment scenario, such as an urban or rural area. In this paper, we generated four different scenarios defined by the ITU via the ray tracing simulator. Then, we used the spatial geometric relation and the curve fitting approach to derive the analytic models to predict the probability of the UAV LOS channels for different scenarios. Results show that our proposed relationships yield better prediction results than the methods in the literature.

It is an enhanced version of the multiple Flying Sidekicks Traveling Salesman Problem (mFSTSP) presented in Murray and Raj (2020) wherein drones are allowed to visit several customers per trip. In order to cope with large instances of the complex TmDTL, we have developed a novel agent-based method where agents represent the points that are going to be visited by vehicles. Agents evolve by means of movement inside a grid (locations vs. vehicles) according to a set of rules in the seek of better objective function values. Each agent needs to explore only a fraction of the complete problem, sharing its progress with the rest of the agents which are coordinated by one central agent which helps to maintain an asynchronous memory of solutions - e.g. on the control of the mechanism to escape from local minima. Our agent-based approach is firstly tested using the largest instances of the single TDTL problem reported in the literature, which additionally serves as upper bounds to the TmDTL problem. Secondly, we have solved instances up to 500 locations with up to 6 drones in the fleet. Thirdly, we have tested the behavior of our approach in 500 locations problems with up to 8 drones in order to test the fleet size sensitivity. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed agent-based system to obtain good quality solutions for complex optimization problems that arise.

Detailed models of the UAV, buoy, and the coupled tethered system dynamics are presented in a marine environment that includes surface water currents and oscillating gravity waves, in addition to wind gusts. This work extends the previously modeled planar (vertical) motion of this novel robotic system to allow its free motion in all three dimensions. Furthermore, a directional surge velocity control system (DSVCS) is proposed to allow both the free movement of the UAV around the buoy when the cable is slack, and the manipulation of the buoy's surge velocity when the cable is taut. Using a spherical coordinates system centered at the buoy, the control system commands the UAV to apply forces on the buoy at specific azimuth and elevation angles via the tether, which yields a more appropriate realization of the control problem as compared to the Cartesian coordinates, where the traditional x-, y-, and z-coordinates do not intuitively describe the tether's tension and orientation. The proposed robotic system and controller offer a new method of interaction and collaboration between UAVs and marine systems from a locomotion perspective, and offers a low-cost and low-logistics alternative to crewed vessels for marine missions.

However, the autonomous navigation for UAVs in indoor map-less environments while performing an inventory mission is, to this day, an open issue for researchers. This article examines the method of leveraging RFID technology with UAVs for the problem of the design of a fully autonomous UAV used for inventory in indoor spaces. This work also proposes a solution for increasing the performance of the autonomous exploration of inventory zones using a UAV in unexplored warehouse spaces. The main idea is to design an indoor UAV equipped with an onboard autonomous navigation system called RFID-based stigmergic and obstacle avoidance navigation system (RFID-SOAN). RFID-SOAN is composed of a computationally low cost obstacle avoidance (OA) algorithm and a stigmergy-based path planning and navigation algorithm. It uses the same RFID tags that retailers add to their products in a warehouse for navigation purposes by using them as digital pheromones or environmental clues. Using RFID-SOAN, the UAV computes its new path and direction of movement based on an RFID density-oriented attraction function, which estimates the optimal path through sensing the density of previously unread RFID tags in various directions relative to the pose of the UAV. We present the results of the tests of the proposed RFID-SOAN system in various scenarios. In these scenarios, we replicate different typical warehouse layouts with different tag densities, and we illustrate the performance of the RFID-SOAN by comparing it with a dead reckoning navigation technique while taking inventory. We prove by the experiments results that the proposed UAV manages to adequately estimate the amount of time it needs to read up-to 99.33% of the RFID tags on its path while exploring and navigating toward new zones of high populations of tags. We also illustrate how the UAV manages to cover only the areas where RFID tags exist, not the whole map, making it very efficient, compared to the traditional map/way-points-based navigation.

However, MEC-based smart systems require heterogeneous and diverse services support. Taking unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) last-mile delivery system as an example, there are two types of services required: delivery and computational services. The edge services in MEC environments are distributed and limited. Inefficient service selection plans will affect the quality of services of such smart systems.

However, the UAV's limited energy storage makes it difficult to perform long-distance delivery tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal logistics framework based on crowdsourcing, in which the UAVs can call on ground vehicles to provide hitch services for energy saving and extending their delivery distance. This multimodal logistics framework is formulated as a two-stage model to jointly consider the incentive mechanism design for crowdsourced ground vehicles and path planning for UAVs. In Stage I, to deal with the motivations for ground vehicles to assist UAV delivery, a dynamic pricing scheme is proposed to best balance the vehicle response time and payments to ground vehicles. It shows that a higher price should be decided if the vehicle response time is long to encourage more vehicles to offer a ride. In Stage II, the task allocation and path planning of the UAVs over the traffic network is studied on the basis of the vehicle response time obtained in Stage I. To address pathfinding with restrictions and the performance degradation of the pathfinding algorithm due to the rising number of conflicts in multi-agent pathfinding, we propose the suboptimal conflict avoidance-based path search (CABPS) algorithm, which has polynomial time complexity. Finally, we validate our results via simulations. It is shown that our approach is able to increase the success rate of UAV package delivery.

However, ensuring safety in the decision-making processes surrounding UAV operations in real-world settings has become an urgent and complex challenge. At present, the main methods to minimise the risk of drone decision-making include utilising pre-established control rules, expert prior knowledge and regularisation constraints. However, these methodologies require UAVs to meet demanding prerequisites, including the acquisition of extensive decision-making experience and the establishment of comprehensive rules. Regrettably, these strict requirements often lead to frequent UAV crashes in uncertain environments and subsequent mission failures. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a self-decision-making method for quadcopter UAVs based on safe reinforcement learning. Our method utilises a multilevel cascading feature semantic space for reinforcement learning, integrating depth images, greyscale images, semantic segmentation images and object detection results as inputs. This approach aims to facilitate safe autonomous learning. Moreover, we integrate real offline labelled data to enhance the safety policy. Depending on the varying levels of risk encountered during the UAV's decision-making process, we dynamically select different safety policies.

Drastically different results are obtained when customers can be grouped in a delivery route. UAV deliveries are not more CO(2)e efficient than tricycle or electric van delivery services if a few customers can be grouped in a route.

Design/methodology/approach This UAV adopts tiltable ducted rotor combined with fixed wing, which has the characteristics of fast flight speed, large carrying capacity and long endurance.

{"text": "Title: Airborne combined photogrammetry-infrared thermography applied to landslide remote monitoring Abstract: The combination between two remote surveying methods is presented herein as a pioneering approach for landslide airborne monitoring. The survey of an active landslide by UAV-based RGB photogrammetry and infrared thermography, sided by the knowledge of the field condition, allowed increasing the scientific experience on the remote sensing of slope instability phenomena by analyzing multiple aspects related to the evolution of key slope features. In this research, the state and distribution of activity of a landslide was monitored by matching data arising from three-dimensional models of the slope, built by exploiting the aerial RGB photogrammetric technology, and thermal outcomes, resulting from the airborne application of infrared thermography principles. In this frame, thermal anomalies detected during different monitoring campaigns allowed recognizing peculiar features along the unstable slope that could be related to specific kinematic elements involved in the landslide activity. Forming cracks, developing scarps, wet terrain portions, and loose material are some of the elements that could be located by integrating thermal outcomes with Digital Surface Models of the slope. Thanks to the different thermal behavior of such elements, strengthened herein by a novel approach of thermal data processing (i.e. the study of thermal slope profiles), the lateral and retrogressive evolution of the studied movement was first hypothesized and then verified in field. Achieved results show that the location of thermal anomalies well corresponds to field structures, which sometimes are hardly detectable by in situ or RGB surveys, thus suggesting the high potential of the methodological approach developed for this study. The scientific validity of presented data gains relevance thanks to the positive field validation. This paves the way to further studies aimed at implementing the infrared aerial survey of landslides, which surely could bring benefits to practical applications in terms of survey speed and spatial coverage, especially in areas characterized by bad field logistics.

{"text": "Title: Hybrid DNN-Based Flight Power Estimation Framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in logistics and communication, though they were initially used for military purposes. However, because the motor must always be rotated, the flight range of an UAV is limited, which, in turn, restricts the scope of UAV applications. Of course, if UAV power consumption is predicted using AI, it is possible to effectively plan UAV operations by deriving optimal energy-efficient flight paths during the simulation phase. However, when using deep neural networks (DNNs) to build a UAV power consumption model, it is difficult to make accurate inferences based solely on flight velocity data. For precise predictions, random vibration acceleration data, as a result of thrust and resistance, are also required. Unfortunately, such information cannot be obtained during the simulation phase and can only be acquired through the actual flight environment. In this paper, we propose the first hybrid DNN-based power model that combines a DNN-based power consumption model and a data-driven random vibration acceleration model that derives UAV random vibration acceleration information based on flight velocity and environment. The proposed modeling framework was evaluated with flight experiments, demonstrating a 6.12% root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE), which is 39.45% more accurate when compared with a conventional DNN-only power model. In addition, we performed case studies to show that it is possible to find energy-efficient flight paths. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: High-accuracy UAV photogrammetry of ice sheet dynamics with no ground control Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and structure from motion with multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry are increasingly common tools for geoscience applications, but final product accuracy can be significantly diminished in the absence of a dense and well-distributed network of ground control points (GCPs). This is problematic in inaccessible or hazardous field environments, including highly crevassed glaciers, where implementing suitable GCP networks would be logistically difficult if not impossible. To overcome this challenge, we present an alternative geolocation approach known as GNSS-supported aerial triangulation (GNSS-AT). Here, an on-board carrier-phase GNSS receiver is used to determine the location of photo acquisitions using kinematic differential carrier-phase positioning. The camera positions can be used as the geospatial input to the photogrammetry process. We describe the implementation of this method in a low-cost, custom-built UAV and apply the method in a glaciological setting at Store Glacier in western Greenland. We validate the technique at the calving front, achieving topographic uncertainties of +/- 0.12 m horizontally (similar to 1.1 x the ground sampling distance) and +/- 0.14 m vertically (similar to 1.3 x the ground sampling distance), when flying at an altitude of similar to 450 m above ground level. This compares favourably with previous GCP-derived uncertainties in glacial environments and allows us to apply the SfM-MVS photogrammetry at an inland study site where ice flows at 2 m day(-1) and stable ground control is not available. Here, we were able to produce, without the use of GCPs, the first UAV-derived velocity fields of an ice sheet interior. Given the growing use of UAVs and SfM-MVS in glaciology and the geosciences, GNSS-AT will be of interest to those wishing to use UAV photogrammetry to obtain high-precision measurements of topographic change in contexts where GCP collection is logistically constrained.

In this study, the first of its kind commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) urban delivery program in China is targeted. Different from the traditional ground pickup and delivery services, the aerial mode considers not only the time window constraints, but also the spatial conflicts incurred during the take-off and landing operations of UAVs. To obtain the optimal flying routes of the focused problem, a mixed integer programming model is formulated. Due to its inherent complexity, the optimal schedule cannot be attained within acceptable time via the off-the-shelf solvers. To help speed up the solving process, a branch-and-cut based exact algorithm is proposed, together with a series of customized valid inequalities. To further accelerate, a greedy insertion heuristic is designed to secure high-quality initial solutions. In the numerical section, it is observed that the algorithm proposed in this paper can help solve the real-life on-demand UAV delivery problem to near optimum (within 5% optimality gap) within reasonable computation time (in 5 minutes). Note to Practitioners-With the increase of labor cost, the distribution cost increases very rapidly. In the meantime, the employment of automated vehicles for logistics reshapes the landscape of the urban last-mile delivery. As an efficient courier carrier, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is trending the autonomous delivery endeavour. When integrating UAVs into the urban delivery program, practitioners need to pay special attention to the scheduling of UAVs at the operational level in addition to the hardware of the UAVs. To help solve the UAV dispatch problem, we propose an online scheduling scheme, considering the spatial conflict constraints in the actual UAV operations. And an exact algorithm is designed to accelerate the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve near optimal dispatch plan with 5% optimality gap in 5 minutes. Furthermore, it is discovered that the demand pooling is an essential decision to make for UAV-based delivery. Longer pooling time can increase the UAV efficiency with more realized demand information, but too much pooling could lead to prolonged customer waiting and a low service level. ", "label": "True"}

{"text": "Title: Optimal scheduling and quantitative analysis for multi-flying warehouse scheduling problem: Amazon airborne fulfillment center Abstract: The outstanding advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have led to an intensive study of the UAV system over the past decade. A variety of potential UAV applications are emerging nowadays, and UAV delivery is one in the limelight. However, one of the critical issues for UAV delivery service is how UAVs can be persistently used within their fundamental limited battery capacity. One recent approach to alleviate the weaknesses is using a cooperative system of UAVs with movable stations for the delivery logistics. The movable stations move across the field of operation, providing persistent delivery service using UAVs by efficiently replenishing the consumables of UAVs. In this study, one of the compelling cooperative delivery services called the flying warehouse system is investigated. The concept of the flying warehouse delivery service has firstly filed as a patent by the e-commerce giant Amazon. The service utilizes airborne fulfillment centers (AFCs), an airship that floats at an altitude of around 45,000. The airship has stocked with inventory, and when a customer places an order, UAVs fly down and deliver the package. The AFC is a novel delivery system that allows delivery in under 10 min and expands Amazon Prime members' access to UAV shipping. On the other hand, AFC is a challenging system that must extract the simultaneous operating schedule of the different system elements. For this purpose, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed. The proposed MILP enables the derivation of service schedules of multiple AFCs and their components. The validity of the MILP is tested through case studies and quantitatively investigated system managerial issues. In addition, we proposed a clustering-based solution approach to provide computational efficiency for real-world case problems. ", "label": "True"}

Easy access to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has opened up new opportunities for remote gas sampling and provides logistical and economic opportunities to improve GHG measurements. Methods This study presents synchronized gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) methods for the analysis of atmospheric gas samples (20-mL glass vessels) to determine the stable isotope ratios and concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O. To our knowledge there is no comprehensive GC/IRMS setup for successive measurement of CO2, CH4 and N2O analysis meshed with a UAV-based sampling system. The systems were built using off-the-shelf instruments augmented with minor modifications. Results The precision of working gas standards achieved for delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of CO2 was 0.2 parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively. The mid-term precision for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of CH4 and N2O working gas standards was 0.4 parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively. Injection quantities of working gas standards indicated a relative standard deviation of 1%, 5% and 5% for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively. Measurements of atmospheric air samples demonstrated a standard deviation of 0.3 parts per thousand and 0.4 parts per thousand for the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values, respectively, of CO2, 0.5 parts per thousand for the delta C-13 value of CH4 and 0.3 parts per thousand for the delta N-15 value of N2O. Conclusions Results from internal calibration and field sample analysis, as well as comparisons with similar measurement techniques, suggest that the method is applicable for the stable isotope analysis of these three important GHGs.

In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are ideal solutions for last-mile delivery scenarios in recent years due to their fast speed and easy deployment. However, because of the highly automatic delivery process, UAVs are still constrained by the limited payload, battery, and computing capacity for complex computational tasks. With the aid of the mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, UAVs can offload computational tasks to the MEC computational resources in various types of IoT environments. In spite of the task offloading which can enhance their task process capability, it also brings extra overhead, such as data transfer time and energy consumption.

The drone pilot was considered an integral part of the drone's flight system control Experimental data was collected with the use of a mobile eye-tracker, video cameras, surveys, and pilot declarations. During the experiment, eight television drone pilot operators recaptured a model shot under the regime of VLOS flight at low altitudes. They all show that both advanced and beginner pilots did not look at the UAV for over half the time of shot execution.

In this proposed system, intertwining logistic map (ILM)-cosine transform aided encryption algorithm combined with artificial noise enhancing physical layer security (PLS) is introduced. Also walsh-hadamard transform technique integrated with QR-decomposition based zero forcing (ZF) block diagonalization (QR-ZF-BD) precoding for multi-user interference reduction and non-iterative clipping and filtering technique for peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction are utilized. In addition, Low density parity check (LDPC) and repeat and accumulate (RA) channel coding with cholesky decomposition based ZF and minimum mean square error signal detection schemes for improved bit error rate (BER) are also introduced. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of PLS for color image transmission at high order digital modulation (16-PSK and 16-QAM). At the complementary cumulative distribution function of probability level 1-6%, the estimated PAPR is found to have value of 6 dB.The three users achieve BER 1x10(-4) at signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5 dB, 4 dB and 6 dB under RA channel coding and 16-QAM digital modulation.

{"text": "Title: \"First Kilometer\" Scheduling Task of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Multisource Heterogeneous Sensors Abstract: To solve the problem of \" first-kilometer\" distribution difficulties in rural areas, we propose a transportation method using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for delivery. The mountainous environment of Fengshan County in Guizhou is first simulated as the UAV delivery environment. A differential evolution strategy based on the improved whale optimization algorithm ( DEIWOA) combined with multisource heterogeneous sensors is then proposed to solve the UAV obstacle avoidance path. After the UAV's delivery path is planned using the DEIWOA algorithm, the multisource heterogeneous sensor is used to perform obstacle avoidance among multiple UAVs and path correction of UAVs in actual situations. Afterwards, to minimize the delivery cost of UAVs, a multi-UAV cargo delivery model is built with the optimization goal of minimizing the transportation cost and time window violation cost. This UAV scheduling model is solved using the proposed DEIWOA algorithm. Finally, simulations are performed to compare the proposed method with the cutting-edge algorithms. The obtained results show that the proposed DEIWOA algorithm can provide a better plan of the UAV path and reduce the cost of logistics scheduling. It can also provide support for UAV logistics and distribution in mountainous areas in actual situations. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Analysis of Canopy Gaps of Coastal Broadleaf Forest Plantations in Northeast Taiwan Using UAV Lidar and the Weibull Distribution Abstract: Canopy gaps are pivotal for monitoring forest ecosystem dynamics. Conventional field methods are time-consuming and labor intensive, making them impractical for regional mapping and systematic monitoring. Gaps may be delineated using airborne lidar or aerial photographs acquired from a manned aircraft. However, high cost in data acquisition and low flexibility in flight logistics significantly reduce the accessibility of the approaches. To address these issues, this study utilized miniature light detection and ranging (lidar) onboard an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV(lidar)) to map forest canopy gaps of young and mature broadleaf forest plantations along the coast of northeastern Taiwan. This study also used UAV photographs (UAV(photo)) for the same task for comparison purposes. The canopy height models were derived from UAV(lidar) and UAV(photo) with the availability of a digital terrain model from UAV(lidar). Canopy gap distributions of the forests were modeled with the power-law zeta and Weibull distributions. The performance of UAV(lidar) was found to be superior to UAV(photo) in delineating the gap distribution through ground observation, mainly due to lidar's ability to detect small canopy gaps. There were apparent differences of the power-law zeta distributions for the young and mature forest stands with the exponents lambda of 1.36 (1.45) and 1.71 (1.61) for UAV(lidar) and UAV(photo), respectively, suggesting that larger canopy gaps were present within the younger stands. The canopy layer of mature forest stands was homogeneous, and the size distributions of both sensors and methods were insensitive to the spatial extent of the monitored area. Contrarily, the young forests were heterogeneous, but only UAV(lidar) with the Weibull distribution responded to the change of spatial extent. This study demonstrates that using the Weibull distribution to analyze canopy gap from high-spatial resolution UAV(lidar) may provide detailed information of regional forest canopy of coastal broadleaf forests.

{"text": "Title: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Hydrology and Water Management: Applications, Challenges, and Perspectives Abstract: The hydrologic sciences and water resources management have long depended on a combination of in situ measurements and remotely sensed data for research and regulatory purposes. In situ measurements are constrained in their spatial distribution by both logistics and costs. Satellite- and manned aircraft-based remote sensing provide spatially broad data, but often of a coarse resolution. Furthermore, all these data collection methods are often limited in their ability to respond to specific short-term events when the data and imagery could inform real-time assessment and decision-making, especially during and immediately after natural disasters. Researchers and regulators are increasingly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fill these gaps in both spatial and temporal data resolution. UAVs are often more cost-effective than traditional remote sensing or in situ data collection methodologies and the availability of new advancements in UAV design, power supply, payload capacity, and sensors has been driving rapid innovations in their use in the hydrological sciences. This in-depth review explores these UAV technologies and how they are being employed for on-demand and cost-effective characterization, monitoring, assessment, and modeling of soil and water resources.

{"text": "Title: A Survey of Recent Extended Variants of the Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Abstract: The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed-through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features-are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones-the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.

However, these studies have focused on linehaul (delivery) demands, excluding a large number of backhaul (pickup) demands.

{"text": "Title: Are unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) the future of wildlife monitoring? A review of accomplishments and challenges Abstract: 1. Regular monitoring of animal populations must be established to ensure wildlife protection, especially when pressure on animals is high. The recent development of drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) opens new opportunities. UASs have several advantages, including providing data at high spatial and temporal resolution, providing systematic, permanent data, having low operational costs and being low-risk for the operators. However, UASs have some constraints, such as short flight endurance. 2. We reviewed studies in which wildlife populations were monitored by using drones, described accomplishments to date and evaluated the range of possibilities UASs offer to provide new perspectives in future research. 3. We focused on four main topics: 1) the available systems and sensors; 2) the types of survey plan and detection possibilities; 3) contributions towards anti-poaching surveillance; and 4) legislation and ethics. 4. We found that small fixed-wing UASs are most commonly used because these aircraft provide a viable compromise between price, logistics and flight endurance. The sensors are typically electro-optic or infrared cameras, but there is the potential to develop and test new sensors. 5. Despite various flight plan possibilities, mostly classical line transects have been employed, and it would be of great interest to test new methods to adapt to the limitations of UASs. Detection of many species is possible, but statistical approaches are unavailable if valid inventories of large mammals are the purpose. 6. Contributions of UASs to anti-poaching surveillance are not yet well documented in the scientific literature, but initial studies indicate that this approach could make important contributions to conservation in the next few years. 7. Finally, we conclude that one of the main factors impeding the use of UASs is legislation. Restrictions in the use of airspace prevent researchers from testing all possibilities, and adaptations to the relevant legislation will be necessary in future. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Application of Postprocessing Kinematic Methods with UAS Remote Sensing in Forest Ecosystems Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) serve as an excellent remote-sensing platform to fulfill an aerial imagery data collection niche previously unattainable in forestry by satellites and manned aircraft. However, for UAS-derived data to be spatially representative, a precise network of ground control points (GCP) is often required, which can be tedious and limit the logistical benefits of UAS rapid deployment capabilities, especially in densely forested areas. Therefore, methods for efficient data collection without GCPs are highly desired in UAS remote sensing. Here, we demonstrate the use of postprocessing kinematic (PPK) technology to obtain subcentimeter precision in datasets of forested areas without the need for placing GCPs. We evaluated two key measures, positional variability and time efficiency, of the PPK technology by comparing them to traditional GCP methods. Results show that PPK displays consistently higher positional precision than traditional GCP approaches. Moreover, PPK surveys and processing take less time to complete than traditional GCP methods and require fewer logistical steps, especially in image acquisition. The time and resource savings with PPK as compared to GCP processing are undeniable. We conclude that PPK technology provides a practical means to produce precise aerial forest surveys. Study Implications: Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have enormous potential for lowering costs and streamlining practices in the forestry management and research community. Despite this potential, however, UAS forestry applications have been limited in scope and precision because of a reliance on using ground-based GPS technology to survey ground control points (GCP), which are time intensive and require an open view of the sky. Such a need for a ground-based GCP survey, along with forest canopy serving to limit and scatter incoming GPS signals, diminishes the potential for rapid deployment and precision mapping offered by UAS. Fortunately, Postprocessing-Kinematic (PPK) GPS technology lowers these barriers by providing the means to seamlessly gather highly precise UAS imagery without needing to conduct time-intensive ground-based surveys. This study compares the precision and time-effectiveness between traditional GCP marker surveys and PPK correction methods. ", "label": "False"}

However, UAV survey strategies have not been widely incorporated in Central Asian archaeological research, and subsequently have not impacted interpretative processes in ways comparable to other regions. Part of the problem lies in the logistical challenges of coperating UAVs in the areas of remote (offline) and rough terrain typical of much of Central Asia, and to this methodological issue we offer some field-tested strategies developed in mountainous areas of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Another significant challenge to UAV-based survey in Central Asia lies in the ongoing development of landscape archaeology as both concept and practice in the region.

{"text": "Title: Unmanned Aerial Survey of Elephants Abstract: The use of a UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) was tested to survey large mammals in the Nazinga Game Ranch in the south of Burkina Faso. The Gatewing x 100 (TM) equipped with a Ricoh GR III camera was used to test animal reaction as the UAS passed, and visibility on the images. No reaction was recorded as the UAS passed at a height of 100 m. Observations, made on a set of more than 7000 images, revealed that only elephants (Loxodonta africana) were easily visible while medium and small sized mammals were not. The easy observation of elephants allows experts to enumerate them on images acquired at a height of 100 m. We, therefore, implemented an aerial strip sample count along transects used for the annual wildlife foot count. A total of 34 elephants were recorded on 4 transects, each overflown twice. The elephant density was estimated at 2.47 elephants/km(2) with a coefficient of variation (CV%) of 36.10%. The main drawback of our UAS was its low autonomy (45 min). Increased endurance of small UAS is required to replace manned aircraft survey of large areas (about 1000 km of transect per day vs 40 km for our UAS). The monitoring strategy should be adapted according to the sampling plan. Also, the UAS is as expensive as a second-hand light aircraft. However the logistic and flight implementation are easier, the running costs are lower and its use is safer. Technological evolution will make civil UAS more efficient, allowing them to compete with light aircraft for aerial wildlife surveys. ", "label": "False"}

Since then, UAVs have quickly gained traction as a feasible option for last-mile operations in transport and logistics. In the context of this research, we construct a mathematical framework aiming to depict the collaborative interaction between trucks and drones in coordinating pickup and delivery tasks with the objective of minimizing operational costs. The drone-assisted pickup and delivery problem (DAPDP) is a variant of the problem in which a single truck departs a depot with parcels and a UAV on board. As the truck picks up packages and makes deliveries, the UAV can also be used to make deliveries to customers near the truck's position. As the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) embarks on its delivery task, the truck continues on its route, making further deliveries along the way and retrieving the UAV at another customer location different from the launch point.

The resulting routine use of underpowered designs could lead to a systematic underestimation of insecticide effects on nontarget arthropod communities. We tested the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for experimental insecticide applications at tree level to increase replication in cost-efficient way. We assessed the effects of two forestry insecticides, diflubenzuron (DFB) and tebufenozide (TBF), on the oak defoliator, Thaumetopoea processionea (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), and on nontarget, tree-living Lepidoptera. Individual trees were sprayed with either insecticide or left unsprayed, in a fully factorial design involving 60 trees. Caterpillars fallen from tree crowns were sampled as a measure of mortality, while caterpillar feeding activity was monitored by collecting frass droppings. Both DFB and TBF led to greater mortality of T. processionea and lower Lepidoptera feeding activity than control levels.

The high treatment efficacy against the target pest indicates that UAV technology is well-suited for the application of insecticide in forests. We detected distinct responses to different insecticides among nontarget groups and suggest there is an influence of application timing and biological traits in these differences, emphasizing the need for more ecologically orientated risk assessment.

{"text": "Title: Evaluating UAV Alternatives for Post-Disaster Situations: An Integrated Decision-Making Methodology Abstract: The rapid and efficient deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in post-disaster scenarios is recognized as critical for effective management and logistics. The problem of selecting the most suitable UAVs for three key tasks-monitoring, light load transportation, and heavy load transportation-is addressed in this study. An extensive review of related literature was conducted to identify specific evaluation criteria tailored to each task. The UAV evaluation problem has been divided into three sub-problems, and an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed within a Pythagorean Fuzzy environment for evaluation. The Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method was employed to determine criteria weights. To rank UAVs currently available on the market, the Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) and Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) techniques were applied, with the Copeland Score used to aggregate and finalize the ranking based on each UAV's overall performance across criteria. The results highlight key UAV choices for each task, guiding decision-makers toward UAVs that best meet the specific operational needs of post-disaster logistics.

{"text": "Title: Intelligent Collaborative Localization Among Air-Ground Robots for Industrial Environment Perception Abstract: Multiple mobile robots have gradually played a key role in many industrial systems, such as factory freight logistics system, patrol security in the factory environment, and multirobot collaborative service and work. As a key issue in industrial environment perception, the accurate robot localization can enhance their autonomous ability and is an important branch of robotic studies in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new method for cooperative autonomous localization among air-ground robots in a wide-ranging outdoor industrial environment. The aerial robot first maps an area of interest and achieves self-localization. Then the aerial robot transfers a simplified orthogonal perspective 2.5-D map to the ground robots for collaboration. Within the collaboration, the ground robot achieves pose estimation with respect to the unmanned aerial vehicle pose by instantaneously registering a single panorama with respect to the 2.5-D map. The 2.5-D map is used as the spatial association among air-ground robots. The ground robots estimate the orientation using automatically detected geometric information and generates the translation by aligning the 2.5-D map with a semantic segmentation of the panorama. Our method effectively overcomes the dramatic differences between the air-level view and the ground-level view. A set of experiments is performed in the outdoor industrial environment to demonstrate the applicability of our localization method. The proposed robotic collaborative localization outperforms most consumer sensor in accuracy and also has an outstanding running time. ", "label": "False"}

However, it lacks the spectral range and precision to profile materials and organisms that only hyperspectral sensors can provide. This kind of high-resolution spectroscopy was firstly used in satellites and later in manned aircraft, which are significantly expensive platforms and extremely restrictive due to availability limitations and/or complex logistics. More recently, UAS have emerged as a very popular and cost-effective remote sensing technology, composed of aerial platforms capable of carrying small-sized and lightweight sensors. Meanwhile, hyperspectral technology developments have been consistently resulting in smaller and lighter sensors that can currently be integrated in UAS for either scientific or commercial purposes. The hyperspectral sensors' ability for measuring hundreds of bands raises complexity when considering the sheer quantity of acquired data, whose usefulness depends on both calibration and corrective tasks occurring in pre- and post-flight stages. Further steps regarding hyperspectral data processing must be performed towards the retrieval of relevant information, which provides the true benefits for assertive interventions in agricultural crops and forested areas. Considering the aforementioned topics and the goal of providing a global view focused on hyperspectral-based remote sensing supported by UAV platforms, a survey including hyperspectral sensors, inherent data processing and applications focusing both on agriculture and forestrywherein the combination of UAV and hyperspectral sensors plays a center roleis presented in this paper. Firstly, the advantages of hyperspectral data over RGB imagery and multispectral data are highlighted. Then, hyperspectral acquisition devices are addressed, including sensor types, acquisition modes and UAV-compatible sensors that can be used for both research and commercial purposes. Pre-flight operations and post-flight pre-processing are pointed out as necessary to ensure the usefulness of hyperspectral data for further processing towards the retrieval of conclusive information. With the goal of simplifying hyperspectral data processingby isolating the common user from the processes' mathematical complexityseveral available toolboxes that allow a direct access to level-one hyperspectral data are presented.

People no longer go to the ground floor to receive a postal package. In the meantime, the delivery of postal packages through the balconies and windows of the units on the upper floors of the buildings will gradually become inevitable. Hence, a new Vehicle Routing Problem with Drone mathematical model has been developed with the objective of minimizing total delivery time and with the ability to deliver postal packages in the path of drones at different heights. In addition, the drone's energy consumption is computed by taking into account wind speed, the weight of the postal parcel, the weight of the drone's body, and other factors in the drone's path. A two-phase algorithm based on the nearest neighborhood and local search is presented to solve the developed mathematical model in different instances. Several small-sized test problems are designed and solved, and the performance of the heuristic approach is evaluated compared to the outputs of the CPLEX solver.

{"text": "Title: Mitigating Risk in UAV Aid Delivery Missions: A Safe Path Prioritization Approach Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in delivering life-saving supplies, such as medication and food, to remote or hazardous locations, including areas affected by conflicts and natural disasters. This research focuses on the complex challenges of planning UAV routes in high-risk environments, where real-time adjustments to flight strategies are often necessary to ensure mission success and the safety of the UAVs. As a case study, we consider scenarios involving UAVs delivering essential aid to vulnerable groups in unsafe areas, which presents unique logistical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a novel model based on Safe Path Prioritization, which emphasizes the selection of previously flown and confirmed safe paths over sending UAVs into unknown, potentially dangerous areas. Our innovative approach combines two advanced tools for efficient route planning: Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) for effective pathfinding and a genetic algorithm-based mechanism for optimizing routes. Additionally, the model utilizes a dynamic risk map to enhance decision-making, ensuring that UAVs aim to visit the closest beneficiary groups while accounting for critical constraints such as battery consumption. The proposed method was rigorously validated through extensive computer simulations, which varied configurations, including the number of beneficiary groups, UAVs, and unsafe zones. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in operational effectiveness: specifically, there was a 28% increase in the number of beneficiary groups visited and a remarkable 71% increase in successful deliveries, even under less favorable conditions that necessitated longer flight paths. Conversely, in scenarios deemed less challenging, UAVs tended to reduce visits to beneficiary groups, prioritizing safer but lengthier routes. Overall, our findings illustrate that Safe Path Prioritization is a reliable and effective method for completing missions where both UAV preservation and timely aid delivery to beneficiary groups are of paramount importance.

However, there is no literature yet addressing a comprehensive assessment of them. To bridge this research gap, this paper aimed to compare UAVs to SUGVs in the context of urban parcel delivery from a practical, conceptual, technological, commercial, and environmental perspective. Methodology: Based on structured literature and web research, this paper provided a comparative status quo review of these two delivery concepts. We introduced a parameter-based cost calculus model to estimate the costs per shipment for each technology. To detect the key cost drivers, we applied a one-way sensitivity analysis, as well as a \"full factorial design of experiment\" approach. Results: These key cost drivers for both operations are the \"number of vehicles per operator\" and the \"average beeline service radius\". From today's commercial point of view, our model indicated better profitability of SUGVs. However, technical and regulatory developments may render different results in the future. As SUGVs emit significantly less noise than UAVs, we assume that SUGVs have an additional advantage for usage in autonomous urban last mile delivery from a resident's perspective. Conclusions: Both key cost drivers will significantly influence the commercial viability of unmanned home delivery services. Safety and security aspects will determine regulatory rules on \"number of vehicles per operator\".

In this paper, we consider an air-andground cooperative wireless network that enables dynamic coverage to support the flexible scheduling of the automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) in the IWLS.

On small time scales, we devise an online power control algorithm (OPCA) by using some of stochastic network optimization methods. With current channel conditions, the OPCA can generate the real-time power control policy and ensure the longterm rate requirement.

Online retailers and delivery companies such as Amazon, are already filing up patents for the development of multi-level fulfilment centres for unmanned aerial vehicles or drone-beehives that would allow the deployment of this technology within built environment. A substantial amount of research has been carried out in the last years on the potential use of drones for parcel delivery, principally in the area of logistic optimisation.

The performed analyses indicates that under the scenario considered as the most technologically realistic, up to 7% of EU citizens could get access to such services. When considering technological improvements scenarios, the share reaches 30%.

One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantly reduced their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength.

{"text": "Title: Route Optimization in Precision Agriculture Settings: A Multi-Steiner TSP Formulation Abstract: In this work, we propose a route planning strategy for heterogeneous mobile robots in Precision Agriculture (PA) settings. Given a set of agricultural tasks to be performed at specific locations, we formulate a multi-Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to define the optimal assignment of these tasks to the robots as well as the respective optimal paths to be followed. The optimality criterion aims to minimize the total time required to execute all the tasks, as well as the cumulative execution times of the robots. Costs for travelling from one location to another, for maneuvering and for executing the task as well as limited energy capacity of the robots are considered. In addition, we propose a sub-optimal formulation to mitigate the computational complexity by leveraging the fact that generally in PA settings only a few locations require agricultural tasks in a certain period of interest compared to all possible locations in the field. A formal analysis of the optimality gap between the optimal and the sub-optimal formulations is provided. The effectiveness of the approach is validated in a simulated orchard where three heterogeneous aerial vehicles perform inspection tasks. Note to Practitioners-This paper aims at providing an efficient solution to PA needs by deploying a team of robots able to perform agricultural tasks at given locations in large-scale orchards. In particular, a novel general optimization problem is proposed that, given a set of mobile and possibly heterogeneous robots and a set of agricultural tasks to carry out, defines the assignment of these tasks to the robots as well as the routes to follow, while minimizing the total and the cumulative execution times of the robots. Existing approaches for route optimization in PA generally involves complete coverage of the field by one or multiple robots and do not account for maneuvering costs with general layouts of the field. We consider costs for travelling from one location to another, for executing the task and for maneuvering without any restriction on the layout of the plants as well as we take into account the limited energy capacity of the robots. We also provide a sub-optimal formulation which reduces the computational burden by relaxing the optimization of the maneuvering costs at the locations where agricultural tasks are carried out and formally derive the optimality gap. The proposed approach is flexible and can be easily adapted to any PA setting involving multiple mobile robots that are required to accomplish given tasks in an area of interest.

{"text": "Title: On the Concerted Design and Scheduling of Multiple Resources for Persistent UAV Operations Abstract: A fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) supported by logistics infrastructure, such as automated service stations, may be capable of long-term persistent operations. Typically, two key stages in the deployment of such a system are resource selection and scheduling. Here, we endeavor to conduct both of these phases in concert for persistent UAV operations. We develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to formally describe this joint design and scheduling problem. The MILP allows UAVs to replenish their energy resources, and then return to service, using any of a number of candidate service station locations distributed throughout the field. The UAVs provide service to known determin-istic customer space-time trajectories. There may be many of these customer missions occurring simultaneously in the time horizon. A customer mission may be served by several UAVs, each of which prosecutes a different segment of the customer mission. Multiple tasks may be conducted by each UAV between visits to the service stations. The MILP jointly determines the number and locations of resources (design) and their schedules to provide service to the customers. We address the computational complexity of the MILP formulation via two methods. We develop a branch and bound algorithm that guarantees an optimal solution and is faster than solving the MILP directly via CPLEX. This method exploits numerous properties of the problem to reduce the search space. We also develop a modified receding horizon task assignment heuristic that includes the design problem (RHTA(d)). This method may not find an optimal solution, but can find feasible solutions to problems for which the other methods fail. Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the RHTA(d) and branch and bound methods relative to the MILP solved via CPLEX. For the experiments conducted, the branch and bound algorithm and RHTA(d) are about 500 and 25,000 times faster than the MILP solved via CPLEX, respectively. While the branch and bound algorithm obtains the same optimal value as CPLEX, RHTA(d) sacrifices about 5.5 % optimality on average. ", "label": "True"}

A genetic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the complex routing problem, and an experimental analysis is made to illustrate and validate our model and the algorithm. We found that, under both these two traffic restrictions, UAV delivery can accomplish deliveries that cannot be carried out or are carried out at much higher costs by vehicles only and can always effectively save costs and cut CO(2)emissions, which is environmentally friendly.

UAVs mainly communicate with mobile base stations, ground stations (GS), or networked peer UAVs, known as UAV swarms. UAVs communicate with GS, or UAV swarms, over wireless channels to support mission-critical operations. Communication latency, bandwidth, and precision are of prime importance in such operations. With the rise of data-driven applications, fifth-generation (5G) networks would face bottlenecks to communicate at near-real-time, at low latency and improved coverage. Thus, researchers have shifted towards network designs that incorporate beyond 5G (B5G) networks for UAV designs. However, UAVs are resource-constrained, with limited power and battery, and thus centralized cloud-centric models are not suitable. Moreover, as exchanged data is through open channels, privacy and security issues exist. Federated learning (FL) allows data to be trained on local nodes, preserving privacy and improving network communication. However, sharing of local updates is required through a trusted consensus mechanism. Thus, blockchain (BC)-based FL schemes for UAVs allow trusted exchange of FL updates among UAV swarms and GS. To date, limited research has been carried out on the integration of BC and FL in UAV management. The proposed survey addresses the gap and presents a solution taxonomy of BC-based FL in UAVs for B5G networks due to the open problem. This paper presents a reference architecture and compares its potential benefits over traditional BC-based UAV networks. Open issues and challenges are discussed, with possible future directions.

{"text": "Title: JRCS: Joint Routing and Charging Strategy for Logistics Drones Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are currently being used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through applications, including the delivery of medical supplies, aerial spraying, and public space monitoring. In a pandemic, drone-based delivery is a promising and highly efficient method to reduce transportation time, cost, and exposure to infection. However, owing to both the limited battery lifetime and the limited functions of UAV in-flight missions, it is difficult to implement multiple deliveries over long distances in a single transportation mission. In this article, we study how to extend the drone flight time with charging stations and ensure multiple deliveries in a single mission. For multiple long-distance deliveries, optimization methods are required to design the delivery area networks of customers, charging stations, and delivery routes. We propose a joint routing and charging strategy (JRCS) comprising three phases to perform multiple deliveries in a single mission. We first split the customers of a delivery area using a clustering algorithm according to their distance from the nearest charging station and the maximum flight range. The second phase provides flight segmentation and intersegment routes between the depot, customer locations, and charging stations based on the maximum flight range and safe flight distance. The joint consideration of drone routes with charging stations minimizes the number of charging stations and ensures safe delivery. Finally, we formulate mixed-integer linear programming to solve the drone delivery route problem. According to simulation results, the proposed JRCS outperforms existing delivery approaches in terms of various performance metrics. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Enhancing offshore parcel delivery efficiency through vessel-unmanned aerial vehicle collaborative routing Abstract: Offshore oil and gas production is vital for global energy supply, but it faces logistical challenges due to the high costs and inefficiencies of traditional supply methods. This paper introduces the vessel-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) routing problem with multiple visits in a single flight (VURP-M), a novel logistical model that addresses aimed at enhancing the replenishment of offshore platforms with small, essential items. The VURP-M allows the UAV to perform multiple visits during a single flight, optimising the delivery process. To tackle the VURP-M, we propose two mixed-integer second-order cone programs that capture the problem's complexities. Given its NP-hard nature, we employ an adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) method, featuring a segmented initialisation process and problem-specific operators guided by a rule-based mechanism to improve solution efficiency. The ALNS formulates an initial solution by solving a travelling salesman problem to create a giant tour, which is then used to group sequential targets into multiple UAV flights. The subsequent optimal resolution of a SOCP determines the take-off and landing points for each flight. Subsequently, the ALNS refines the initial solution through destroy and repair operators, enhancing the search for superior sequences and allocation schemes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a real-world case study and numerical experiments on random instances featuring up to 100 platforms. The results offer implications of the collaborative vessel-UAV model for the offshore logistics industry. ", "label": "True"}

Each of the vans is equipped with a single robot, and the robots can visit areas with van access restrictions, such as pedestrianized areas or university campuses. The time during which electric vans are carrying robots can be used to recharge the robots, thereby increasing the efficiency of the distribution system. To model the proposed system, we present a mixed integer program. We note that the energy transfer from a van to its robot needs time and will cause the available travel distance of a van to decrease and that of a robot to increase. Focusing on the new time-distance-energy trade-off problem, which increases the difficulty checking the feasibility of any given route, we further propose a greedy route evaluation approach and a linear programming-based route evaluation method. An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is presented for solving larger instances. A sensitivity analysis for vehicle charging modes, charging rates, and maximum battery capacities shows that using en-route charging, while appropriately increasing battery level and charging rate can have useful effects on cost.

When users are interested in sensory data in certain areas covered by UAV networks, they can send a spatio-temporal range query with time and geography constraints through the ground station. For example, obtaining the temperature information around fire points in the forest within an hour before the fire bursts out. Then, UAVs that carry the query results will return the data to the ground station through multi-hop routing. However, most of the existing spatio-temporal range query algorithms are designed for static networks. How to conduct spatio-temporal range queries in the UAV networks is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a Trajectory-Aware Spatio-Temporal range query processing algorithm (TAST) for UAV networks. The ground station takes advantage of the pre-planned trajectory information of UAVs to build the topology change model of the UAV network, which can reflect the changes of UAVs' communication links and neighbors. Furthermore, the static topology change graph (TCG) is proposed for optimizing the routing of query results in the spatio-temporal query processing. Next, we propose a Trajectory-Aware Spatio-Temporal range query processing algorithm based on packet Splitting (TASTS), which is used to split large query results into multiple small packets called unit packets, and each unit packet is transmitted back to the ground station independently and efficiently. Finally, we evaluated our algorithms through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that TAST and TASTS perform well in terms of query success rate, query efficiency and overhead ratio.

Whereas, most of the existing logistics UAV delivery models have not taken the energy consumption of the logistics UAVs and mixed time windows of the customers, which leads to their models cannot be applied in practical transportation systems. Therefore, we propose to minimize the total energy cost of multiple logistics UAVs during the customized products delivery period for a smart transportation system. Taking the energy consumption variation of the logistics UAVs, mixed time windows of the customers, as well as simultaneous delivery and pick up into consideration, we formulate a cooperative path planning problem via jointly optimizing the route of the logistics UAVs and the service allocation. To solve this large-scale integer programming problem, we employ the Large Neighborhood Search Algorithm (LNS) to accelerate the convergence rate of Genetic Algorithm (GA), and then develop an improved GA based cooperative path planning algorithm (IGCPA). The optimization procedure of the proposed algorithm IGCPA is divided into two phases, using the GA crossover operator and variational operator in the global search phase and LNS operator in the local search phase, and validating the integer programming model and the effectiveness of the solution algorithm based on different scale cases. Finally, abundant simulation results show that the energy cost of IGCPA is reduced by 17.35%, 15.18% and 9.99% compared with GA, LNS and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), respectively. Furthermore, the IGCPA is validated using Solomn standard data, which further verifies that the IGCPA can enhance the convergence rate of GA as well as obtain a lower delivery cost.

Ground-based photogrammetric techniques are less invasive, but inherent limitations make them impractical for many field applications. The recent proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in wildlife monitoring has provided a promising new platform for the photogrammetry of free-ranging pinnipeds. Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are an apex predator in coastal Antarctica whose body condition could be a valuable indicator of ecosystem health.

Flights were conducted in January and February of 2013 and 2014 and 50 photogrammetric samples were obtained from 15 unrestrained seals. UAS-derived measurements of standard length were accurate to within 2.01 +/- 1.06%, and paired comparisons with ground measurements were statistically indistinguishable. An allometric linear mixed effects model predicted leopard seal mass within 19.40 kg (4.4% error for a 440 kg seal).

Drone-truck combined operation (DTCO) solutions are based on vehicle routes and drone launch and retrieval locations, usually customer nodes. Since a perfect synchronization of both vehicles is very rare, most of the solutions obtained after designing combined delivery routes generally contain time losses, caused by the need for the first vehicle that reaches the meeting point to wait until the arrival of the other.

Hence, we investigate the max-min secrecy fairness of UAV-aided cellular networks, in which Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) aided downlink transmissions are employed by each multi-antenna UAV Base Station (UAV-BS) to safeguard the downlink of a two-user Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system against an external multi-antenna Eavesdropper (Eve). Realistically, only Imperfect Channel State Information (ICSI) is assumed to be available at the transmitter. Additionally, we consider a realistic total power constraint and guarantee the specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the legitimate users. To handle the worst-case channel uncertainty of the legitimate users and an external Eve, we conceive a robust secure resource allocation algorithm, which maximizes the minimum worst-case secrecy rate of the legitimate users. Based on the CRS principle, the transmitter splits and encodes the messages of legitimate users into common as well as private streams and the user having stronger CSI is asked to help the cell-edge user by opportunistically forwarding its decoded common message. In contrast to the existing schemes adopted in the literature for ensuring secure transmission of the first cooperative phase only, in our proposed solution the common message has a twin-fold mission. Explicitly, apart from serving as the desired message, it also acts as Artificial Noise (AN) for drowning out Eve without consuming extra power. This is in stark contrast to the conventional AN designs. In the second phase, the pure AN is directed towards the Eve, deploying a robust Maximum Ratio Transmitter (MRT) beamformer at the UAV-BS. To solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem we resort to the Sequential Parametric Convex Approximation (SPCA) method together with a bespoke initialization algorithm to avoid any failure due to infeasibility.

{"text": "Title: The parallel drone scheduling problem with multiple drones and vehicles Abstract: Delivery of goods into urban areas constitutes an important issue for logistics service providers. One of the most talked-about developments in recent years has been the potential use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, for transporting packages, food, medicine, and other goods. Delivery by drones offers new possibilities, but also induces new challenging routing problems. In this paper, we address and extend the so-called Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem. Basically, in this problem, deliveries are split between a vehicle and one or several drones. The vehicle performs a classical delivery tour from the depot, while the drones are constrained to perform back and forth trips. The objective is to minimize the completion time. We extend the problem by considering several vehicles. We call it Parallel Drone Scheduling Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic for its solution. The procedure starts by building a giant tour visiting all customers. Then, the giant tour is split in order to determine a set of vehicles tours (each vehicle tour following the order defined by the giant tour) and a set of customers assigned to drones. Thirdly, an improvement step move customers between vehicles or between vehicles and drones. We also propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation and a simple branch-and-cut approach. The proposed approach is validated via an experimental campaign on instances taken from the CVRPLIB1 library. Computational experiments comparing several variants of the hybrid metaheuristic give some insights on this drone delivery system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Vulnerability Analysis of UAV Swarm Network with Emergency Tasks Abstract: With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV swarms are used for emergency tasks in various scenarios such as area detection, fire rescue, logistics, and transportation. However, for complex scenarios, UAV swarms are prone to environmental interference that damages their equipment or disrupts their communication links, affecting the normal execution of tasks. In this paper, an information-communication interdependent network model is designed for the vulnerability analysis of UAV swarm networks with emergency tasks. Firstly, from the perspective of network functions of a UAV swarm, we introduce the theory of interdependent networks to abstract the relationship between the UAV swarm's communication network and its information network, where the communication network represents its communication topology and the information network is related to the function of each UAV individual in the UAV swarm. Then, the vulnerability of the UAV swarm is analyzed according to the relationship between network construction costs and network connectivity under environmental interference. Finally, the effectiveness of the vulnerability analysis method is verified through simulation. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Vehicle and UAV Collaborative Delivery Path Optimization Model Abstract: In the context of frequent public emergencies, emergency logistics distribution is particularly critical, and because of the unique advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the model of coordinated delivery of vehicles and UAVs is gradually becoming an essential form of emergency logistics distribution. However, the omission of start-up costs prevents the cost of UAV battery replacement and the sorting, assembly and verification of packages from being factored into the total cost. Furthermore, most existing models focus on route optimization and delivery cost, which cannot fully reflect the customer's desire for service satisfaction under emergency conditions. It is necessary to convert the unsatisfactory degree of time window into a penalty cost rather than a model constraint. Additionally, there is a lack of analysis on the mutual waiting cost between vehicles and UAVs when one of them is performing delivery tasks. Considering the effects of the time window, customer demand, maximum load capacity, and duration of distribution benefits, we propose a collaborative delivery path optimization model for vehicles and UAVs to minimize the total distribution cost. A genetic algorithm is used to obtain the model solution under the constraints of distribution subloops, distribution order, and take-off and landing nodes. To assess the efficacy of the vehicle and UAV collaborative delivery path optimization model, this paper employs a county-level district in Xi'an city as a pilot area for an emergency delivery. Compared with the vehicle-alone delivery model, the UAV-alone delivery model and vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model, this model can significantly reduce the utilization of distribution vehicles while also significantly lowering the start-up cost, waiting cost and penalty cost. Thus, the model can effectively improve delivery timeliness and customer satisfaction. The total cost of this model is 39.2% less than that of the vehicle-alone delivery model and 16.5% less than that of the UAV-alone delivery model. Although its delivery cost is slightly higher than the vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model, the reduction in the start-up cost and penalty cost decrease the overall cost of distribution by 11.8%. This suggests that to cut costs of all sizes and conserve half of the resources used by vehicles, employing the vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model for emergency distribution is preferable. Moreover, the model integrating the start-up cost, penalty cost, waiting cost, etc., can more effectively express the requirements of timeliness for UAV delivery under emergency conditions.

We used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to follow and video-record 25 groups of mating dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) near the surface of the water and examine how behavior patterns varied with mating group type. We collected aerial footage of dolphins mating in traditional Isolated Pods and within Integrated Pods and compared differences in the number of mating animals, swimming speed, bearing change, percent time at the surface of the water, female respiration rate, copulatory position rate, and sex-specific mating behaviors. Only the mean number of mating animals and some sex-specific mating behaviors varied significantly between the two mating group types. More dolphins were engaged in mating behaviors in Isolated Pods than Integrated Pods. Males engaged in more interference behaviors in Isolated Pods compared to Integrated Pods. Females performed fewer speed bursts but more rolls on their backs in Integrated Pods compared to Isolated Pods. Several similarities and differences were found in comparison to boat-based research of the same population of dolphins.

Compared to traditional methods of forests monitoring which mostly use orthophotography from satellites or aircraft, there is very little research on the use of 3D canopy structure to monitor forest growth. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial could be a novel and feasible platform to generate more timely and high resolution forest 3D canopy images. In spring, the forest is supposed to experience rapid growth. In this research, we used a small UAV to monitor campus forest growth in spring at 2-day intervals. Each time, 140 images were acquired and the ground surface dense point cloud was reconstructed at high precision. Excess Green indexes (ExG) was used to extract the green canopy points. The segmented point cloud was triangulated using the greedy projection triangulation method into a mesh and its area was calculated. Forest canopy growth was analyzed at three levels: forest level, selected group level and individual tree level. A logistic curve was used to fit the time series canopy growth. Strong correlation was found R-2 = 0.8517 at forest level, R-2 = 0.9652 at selected group level and R-2 = 0.9606 at individual tree level. Moreover, high correlation was found between canopies. By observing these results, we can conclude that the ground 3D model can act as a useful data type to monitor forest growth. Moreover UAV aerial remote sensing has advantages when monitoring forests in periods when the ground vegetation is growing and changing fast. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Improved grey wolf algorithm based on dynamic weight and logistic mapping for safe path planning of UAV low-altitude penetration Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in many fields, especially in low-altitude penetration defence, which showcases superior performance. UAV requires obstacle avoidance for safe flight and must adhere to various flight constraints, such as altitude changes and turning angles, during path planning. Excellent flight paths can enhance flight efficiency and safety, saving time and energy when performing specific tasks, directly impacting mission accomplishment. To address these challenges, this paper improves the original grey wolf algorithm (GWO). In this enhanced version, the three head wolves randomly assign influence weights to execute the position updating mechanism. A dynamic weight influence strategy is designed, which accelerates convergence in the late optimization stages, aiding in finding the global optimum. Meanwhile, the logistic mapping is introduced into the convergence factor, and a micro-vibrational convergence factor is constructed. This allows the algorithm to have a better ability to find a globally optimal solution in the search space while also being able to search deeper using areas near the currently known information. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, a simulated flight environment is established, conducting simulation experiments within safe flight environments featuring 5, 10, and 15 obstacles. Comparative analysis with seven other algorithms demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better superiority. In terms of path length on three maps, DLGWO paths are 10.3 km, 15.5 km, and 2.6 km shorter than the second-placed MEPSO, SOGWO, and WOA, respectively. Furthermore, the planned path in this study exhibits the smallest fluctuations in altitude and turning angles. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: A branch-and-cut algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with drones Abstract: Increasing online purchases and higher customer requirements in terms of speed, flexibility, and costs of home deliveries are challenges to every company involved in last mile delivery. Technological advances have paved the way for last mile deliveries by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Yet, the limited range and capacity of UAVs remain a challenge. This makes the possibility of pairing drones with well-established means of transportation highly attractive. However, the optimization problem arising in joint delivery by truck and drone has only recently been considered in the literature. We develop a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) with two different time-oriented objective functions. Additionally, we introduce new valid inequalities based on problem properties to strengthen the linear relaxation. One type of valid inequalities is an extension of the well known subtour elimination constraints. As the number of these constraints grows exponentially with instance size, we provide a separation routine that identifies violated cuts in relaxed solutions to add them efficiently. We therefore derive the first branch-and-cut algorithm for the VRPD. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the competitiveness of our MILP formulation and to show the impact of different combinations of valid inequalities. We optimally solve instances with unrestricted drone ranges with up to 20 nodes and instances with range-limited drones with up to 30 nodes. These are significantly larger instance sizes than the previously known exact approaches are able to handle. In addition, we introduce a relaxation of the VRPD that provides good lower bounds in notable reduced run times. To provide managerial insights, we show that integrating truck drone tandems into transportation systems can not only lead to improvements regarding the speed of deliveries, but can also be used to reduce the fleet size without slowing down the delivery process and increasing the workload of truck drivers.

By integrating a unique instructed reinforcement principle, this method significantly accelerates the learning process, improving the UAVs' navigational efficiencies. Our findings demonstrate that IR-QLA not only surpasses traditional algorithms like Ant Colony and Particle Swarm Optimization in terms of convergence speed but also minimizes the path length and iteration counts needed for trajectory optimization.

Spectral analysis retrieved from a spectroradiometer and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and imbalanced approaches such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) and machine learning have given promising results for monitoring plant biochemical properties.

We evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of SMOTE, Logistic Model Tree (LMT), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to address data imbalance problems for the assessment of the oil palm nutrients and chlorophylls status. The performance of the raw band and vegetation index (VI) extracted from the UAV in assessing leaf biochemical properties of mature oil palms is also addressed.

Logistics companies face challenges to meet customers' expectations with high efficiency and reliability at a low cost. Hence, this paper investigates the dynamic truck-drone routing problem with scheduled deliveries and on-demand pickups (D-TDRP-SDOP) for an on-demand logistics system. Trucks and drones are deployed to serve a batch of deterministic deliveries and an uncertain set of pickup requests with deadlines subject to maximum working hour constraints. The drones can serve multiple requests per trip subject to load constraints and endurance capacity restrictions. The service provider aims to maximize the total profits by dynamic reassignment and recourse of the vehicles. We formulate the D-TDRP-SDOP problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a heuristic solution approach framework, consisting of an offline enhanced construction algorithm (OECA) and a segment-based heuristic, to solve the MDP. The comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach and the benefits of the model. Our model improves the total profits by 15% by considering on-demand requests, and the drone operations contribute to a 50% improvement in the acceptance rate of dynamic customer requests. Improved drone technology, such as a higher drone speed and a higher battery capacity, can enable the system to serve more on-demand requests and increase the final profits.

{"text": "Title: The running kinematics of free-roaming giraffes, measured using a low cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV ) Abstract: The study of animal locomotion can be logistically challenging, especially in the case of large or unhandleable animals in uncontrolled environments. Here we demonstrate the utility of a low cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in measuring two-dimensional running kinematics from free-roaming giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) in the Free State Province, South Africa. We collected 120 Hz video of running giraffes, and calibrated each video frame using metatarsal length as a constant object of scale. We tested a number of methods to measure metatarsal length. The method with the least variation used close range photography and a trigonometric equation to spatially calibrate the still image, and derive metatarsal length. In the absence of this option, a spatially calibrated surface model of the study terrain was used to estimate topographical dimensions in video footage of interest. Data for the terrain models were collected using the same equipment., during the same study period. We subsequently validated the accuracy of the UAV method by comparing similar speed measurements of a human subject running on a treadmill, with treadmill speed. At 8 m focal distance we observed an error of 8% between the two measures of speed. This error was greater at a shorter focal distance, and when the subject was not in the central field of view. We recommend that future users maximise the camera focal distance, and keep the subject in the central field of view. The studied giraffes used a grounded rotary gallop with a speed range of 3.4-6.9 ms(-1) (never cantering, trotting or pacing), and lower duty factors when compared with other cursorial quadrupeds. As this pattern might result in adverse increases in peak vertical limb forces with speed, it was notable to find that contralateral limbs became more in-phase with speed. Considering the latter pattern and the modest maximal speed of giraffes, we speculate that tissue safety factors are maintained within tolerable bounds this way. Furthermore, the angular kinematics of the neck were frequently isolated from the pitching of the body during running; this may be a result of the large mass of the head and neck. Further field experiments and biomechanical models are needed to robustly test these speculations. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: An Energy-Efficient Logistic Drone Routing Method Considering Dynamic Drone Speed and Payload Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are recognized for their potential to improve efficiency in last-mile delivery. Unlike the vehicle routing problem, drone route design is challenging due to several operational signatures, such as speed optimization, multi-trip operation, and energy consumption estimation. Drone energy consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and payload. Moreover, the high speed of drones can significantly curtail the drone range, thereby limiting the efficiency of drone delivery systems. This paper addresses the trade-off between speed and flight range in a multi-trip drone routing problem with variable flight speeds (DRP-VFS). We propose a new model to specifically consider energy constraints using a nonlinear energy consumption model and treat drone speeds as decision variables. The DRP-VFS is initially formulated using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to minimize energy consumption. To solve large-scale instances, we propose a three-phase adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm and compare its performance with a commercial MIP solver. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of effectively identifying suboptimal solutions in practical scenarios. Furthermore, results indicate that operating drones at variable speeds leads to about 21% energy savings compared to fixed speeds, with advantages in cost savings and range extension.

In reality, the online retailing platform receives grocery orders and promises ultrafast delivery service to the customers via a two-echelon logistics and distribution network. The uncertain arrivals of the orders have a nontrivial negative effect on the performance of the whole delivery network, which has not been well studied in the literature. This paper investigates the parcel consolidation policy and the UAVs routes for the last-mile delivery from a transshipment site in a distribution network to the final customers. First, this study proposes a nonmyopia consolidation policy considering the upcoming grocery parcels with random arrival times to minimize the total delivery cost including the possible penalty cost due to the delivery delay to the customer. To make the problem tractable in the real-time computational setting, an approximation method based on Bayesian estimation is proposed to reduce a large number of random arrival scenarios of upcoming parcels to an expected scenario. The problem is then approached with a deterministic model under the expected scenario. Subsequently, a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm is developed to solve the model. In the algorithm, a novel decoding method is designed to evaluate the particles with respect to the constraints of the load and battery capacities of a UAV and a neighborhood search based on reinforcement learning is developed to improve the quality of the particles in the searching process.

Caribou fences are of archaeological and ecological significance, yet sparsely distributed and increasingly at risk to wildfire. Costly remote field logistics requires efficient prior fence verification and rapid on-site documentation of structure and landscape context. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and very high- resolution (VHR) satellite imagery were used for detailed site recording and detection of coarse woody debris (CWD) objects under challenging Subarctic alpine woodlands conditions. UAVs enabled discovery of previously unknown wooden structures and revealed extensive use of CWD (n = 1745, total length = 2682 m, total volume = 16.7 m(3)). The methodology detected CWD objects much smaller than previously reported in remote sensing literature (mean 1.5 m long, 0.09 m wide), substantiating a high spatial resolution requirement for detection.

{"text": "Title: Use of unmanned vehicles in search and rescue operations in forest fires: Advantages and limitations observed in a field trial Abstract: Search and Rescue (SaR) in forest fires is usually applied in a broad area, under foggy or smoky conditions. It mostly involves location of entrapped fire crew or people in between fire fronts, as well as, safely removing them away from the dangerous zone. Moreover, SaR is applied in evacuation of rural residential areas due to heavy smoke impacts, or fire front approaching. Experiences achieved during a field trial, in which unmanned aerial and ground vehicles were deployed and used in a simulated forest fire SaR scenario, are presented. For planning and running the field trial a number of parameters were taken into consideration; logistics, safety plan, contingency plan, different agencies cooperation, time frames and ethical issues. Advantages of using unmanned aerial and ground vehicles in SaR operations include capability of planning and monitoring the operations, integration with the manned resources, connectivity with command and control centers, as well as, coordination of the different unmanned aerial and ground vehicles' platforms. Significant increase of personnel safety is possible through the capabilities of air quality monitoring and search over dangerous areas. Current limitations include limited heat resistance of vehicles and limited flying capability in strong winds and turbulence. Failure of communications is also possible due to rough terrain (autonomy limitations). Against all the limitations, a number of unmanned vehicles already exist that can be adapted successfully for SaR operations in forest fires. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

{"text": "Title: An optimized multicopter UAV sounding technique (MUST) for probing comprehensive atmospheric variables Abstract: The unique maneuverability, ease of deployment, simplicity in logistics, and relatively low costs of multicopters render them effective vehicles for low atmospheric research. While many efforts have contributed to the fundamental success of atmospheric applications of multicopters in the past, several challenges remain, including limited measurable variables, possible response-delay in real-time observations, insufficient measurement accuracy, endurance of harsh conditions and tolerance towards interferences. To address these challenges and further fortify the applicability in diversified research disciplines, this study developed an optimized multicopter UAV sounding technique (MUST). The MUST serves as an integrated platform by combining self-developed algorithms, optimized working environments for sensors/monitors, and retrofitted sampling devices to probe a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. These variables of interest include meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind direction and speed), the chemical composition (speciated VOCs, CO, CO2, CH4, CO2 isotopologues, O-3, PM2.5, and black carbon), and the radiation flux, as well as visible and thermal images. The aim of this study is to achieve the following objectives: 1. to easily probe a comprehensive set of near-surface atmospheric variables; 2. to improve data quality by correcting for sensors' delay in real-time observations and minimizing environmental interferences; and 3. to enhance the versatility and applicability of aerial measurements by incorporating necessary hardware and software. Field launching cases from the surface to a maximum height of 1000 m were conducted to validate the robustness of the integrated MUST platform with sufficient speed, accuracy and resolution for the target variables.

{"text": "Title: Intelligent Drone Swarms to Search for Victims in Post-Disaster Areas Abstract: This study presents the Drone Swarms Routing Problem (DSRP), which consists of identifying the maximum number of victims in post-disaster areas. The post-disaster area is modeled in a complete graph, where each search location is represented by a vertex, and the edges are the shortest paths between destinations, with an associated weight, corresponding to the battery consumption to fly to a location. In addition, in the DSRP addressed here, a set of drones are deployed in a cooperative drone swarms approach to boost the search. In this context, a V-shaped formation is applied with leader replacements, which allows energy saving. We propose a computation model for the DSRP that considers each drone as an agent that selects the next search location to visit through a simple and efficient method, the Drone Swarm Heuristic. In order to evaluate the proposed model, scenarios based on the Beirut port explosion in 2020 are used. Numerical experiments are presented in the offline and online versions of the proposed method.

Determining the role of biological soil crust in the energy flow and logistics cycle in the desert ecosystem is one of the frontier areas of ecological restoration in arid and semi-arid areas. Obtaining biological soil crust information from drone images is an efficient, fast, and low-cost method. However, due to the scattered and uneven growth of biological soil crusts and the complexity of the field environment, it is difficult to accurately extract biological soil crusts. In view of this, this study used the improved UNet++ model to extract biological soil crusts based on UAV image data. Firstly, the optimal Epoch, Backbone, and Loss function are selected and trained based on the network structure of UNet++ model. Then, the improved UNet++ model proposed in this paper, which takes ResNeXt as the Backbone and Soft Cross-Entropy Loss+Dice Loss as the Loss Function, is obtained. Finally, the test results of UNet++, U-Net, LinkNet, FPN, and PSPNet are compared with the improved UNet++ model in this paper. The results showed that the improved UNet++ model had the best segmentation effect, and the precision, recall, F1-Score, and IoU were 0.9788, 0.9501, 0.9495, and 0.9309, respectively. UAV image biological soil crust recognition based on the improved UNet++ model in this paper can obtain high-precision extraction results, provide good data support for studying the development of biological soil crusts in arid areas, and provide a new method for precise segmentation of different features in arid areas.

{"text": "Title: Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Path Planning Based on Improved Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm Abstract: For the multi-UAV path planning problem, environmental modeling and an improved swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithm are discussed in this paper. Firstly, to align with reality, specific constraints of UAVs in motions, attitudes and altitudes, real-world threats such as radars and no-fly zones, and inter-UAV collisions are considered. Thus, multi-UAV path planning is transformed into a multi-objective constrained optimization problem. Accordingly, an improved nutcracker optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Through initializing with logistic chaotic mapping and the lens imaging inverse learning strategy, a more fit elite initialization population is produced to increase the efficiency of path planning. Furthermore, by adjusting adaptive parameters and integrating an improved sine-cosine search strategy, a balance between global exploration capability and local exploitation capability during path planning is achieved.

{"text": "Title: A Reinforcement Learning Model of Multiple UAVs for Transporting Emergency Relief Supplies Abstract: In large-scale disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, quick and sufficient transportation of emergency relief supplies is required. Logistics activities conducted to quickly provide appropriate aid supplies (relief goods) to people affected by disasters are known as humanitarian logistics (HL), and play an important role in terms of saving the lives of those affected. In the previous last-mile distribution of HL, supplies are transported by trucks and helicopters, but these transport methods are sometimes not feasible. Therefore, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transport supplies is attracting attention due to their convenience regardless of the disaster conditions. However, existing transportation planning that utilizes UAVs may not meet some of the requirements for post-disaster transport of supplies. Equitable distribution of supplies among affected shelters is particularly important in a crisis situation, but it has not been a major consideration in the logistics of UAVs in the existing study. Therefore, this study proposes transportation planning by introducing three crucial performance metrics: (1) the rapidity of supplies, (2) the urgency of supplies, and (3) the equity of supply amounts. We formulated the routing problem of UAVs as the multi-objective, multi-trip, multi-item, and multi-UAV problem, and optimize the problem with Q-learning (QL), one of the reinforcement learning methods. We performed reinforcement learning for multiple cases with different rewards and quantitatively evaluated the transportation of each countermeasure by comparing them. The results suggest that the model improved the stability of the supply of emergency relief supplies to all evacuation centers when compared to other models. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: A drone fleet model for last-mile distribution in disaster relief operations Abstract: Humanitarian assistance operates under conditions characterized by the collapse of health facilities, the disruption of health systems and the breakdown of already on-going treatments in case of emergency. In addition to these circumstances, aid agencies in developing countries are often confronted with poor or non-existent infrastructure that is further disrupted in case of disasters, i.e., destroyed roads and debris-covered areas which hinder medical teams in reaching remote locations. As the supply via trucks and helicopters is not applicable in this situation, alternative means of transport have to be considered. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are receiving increased attention by humanitarian organizations as they can help overcoming last-mile distribution problems, i.e., inaccessibility to cut-off regions. This paper considers drone applications in last-mile distribution in humanitarian logistics and presents an optimization model for the delivery of multiple packages of lightweight relief items (e.g. vaccine, water purification tablets, etc.) via drones to a certain number of remote locations within a disaster prone area. The objective of the model is to minimize the total travelling distance (or time/cost) of the drone under payload and energy constraints while recharging stations are installed to allow the extension of the operating distance of the drone. The implementation of different priority policies is discussed. The model is solved as a mixed integer linear program and illustrated numerically with different scenarios. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Monitoring Individual Tree Phenology in a Multi-Species Forest Using High Resolution UAV Images Abstract: Monitoring tree phenology is important for understanding ecosystem functioning and for assessing ecosystem responses to climate change. Satellite imagery offers open-access global coverage but is restricted to forest-level analyses, due to its coarse spatial resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery can monitor phenology at the individual tree level by utilizing a centimeter-scale resolution. Two research objectives were identified for this study: (1) to derive phenological metrics at the individual tree level, using various vegetation indices (VIs); and (2) to assess the accuracy of automatic crown delineation in a diverse ecosystem. To achieve this, fourteen multi-spectral UAV flights were performed, and the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and chlorophyll index red-edge (CIre) to model seasonal phenology was assessed. A double logistic model was fitted on the VI observations for each individual tree, to derive the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Individual tree crowns were delineated automatically using marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS), and the treetops were identified using a local maximum filter (LMF). Overall, the automatic segmentation performed well (F-score: 0.79, IoU: 0.58), with higher accuracies in single-species areas, while it underperformed in complex mixed forest structures. All VIs captured a strong seasonal signal for the deciduous trees and derived SOS and EOS estimates consistent with literature and ground observations. General phenological patterns included an early silver birch SOS, a quick beech budburst, and large within-species phenology variations for oak trees. Seasonal VI variation for coniferous evergreen trees was limited, and the resulting phenology estimates proved unreliable. In conclusion, these findings emphasize the capabilities of UAV imagery for individual tree crown phenology monitoring. However, they also show the difficulty of monitoring evergreen phenology with the commonly-used VIs and stress the need for further investigations. ", "label": "False"}

Traditional manual sampling methods are labor-intensive and lack precision. This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model that utilizes unmanned aerial systems (UAS)-based multi-sensor data to predict Napa cabbage fresh weight. The model was developed using high-resolution RGB, multispectral (MSP), and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery collected throughout the 2020 growing season. The imagery was used to extract various vegetation indices, crop features (vegetation fraction, crop height model), and a water stress indicator (CWSI). The deep neural network (DNN) model consistently outperformed support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models, achieving the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.47 kg) during the mid-to-late rosette growth stage (35-42 days after planting, DAP). The model's accuracy improved with cabbage maturity, emphasizing the importance of the heading stage for fresh weight estimation. The model slightly underestimated the weight of Napa cabbages exceeding 5 kg, potentially due to limited samples and saturation effects of vegetation indices. The overall error rate was less than 5%, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Spatial analysis further revealed that the model accurately captured variability in Napa cabbage growth across different soil types and irrigation conditions, particularly reflecting the positive impact of drip irrigation. This study highlights the potential of UAS-based multi-sensor data and AI for accurate and non-invasive prediction of Napa cabbage fresh weight, providing a valuable tool for optimizing harvest timing and crop management. Future research should focus on refining the model for specific weight ranges and diverse environmental conditions, and extending its application to other crops. ", "label": "False"}

Then, improved nonlinear dynamic inertia weights (INDIW) are introduced into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and when the particles fall into the local optimum, the velocity is perturbed, and the velocity and improved nonlinear dynamic inertia weight PSO (VAINDIWPSO) algorithm are obtained. The algorithm improves the speed of convergence and fitness function value of the PSO algorithm. However, the impact of flyable path optimization is now not obvious. Therefore, to further enhance the overall performance of the VAINDIWPSO algorithm, the adaptive adjustment of the velocity is introduced, the chaotic initialization is carried out, and the improved logistic chaotic map is introduced into the algorithm, and an improved chaotic-VAINDIWPSO (IC-VAINDIWPSO) algorithm is obtained. Then, the corresponding relationship between the algorithm and constraints is used to efficiently search complicated environments and find paths with excessive security and small cost function.

This paper presents an innovative logistics UAV scheduling framework using public buses, in which logistics UAVs Land and Recharge its battery on Buses (ULRB) to extend its delivery range and decelerate its fading battery capacity. This work correlates physical layer parameters such as the energy consumption rate, the parcels weight, UAV velocity, the battery temperature to the UAV's path planning, the battery discharging, and the capacity fading models. Specifically, the ULRB framework consists of a single-UAV scheduling module and a multi-UAV dispatching module. In the single-UAV module, a Markov-based algorithm is utilized to plan the UAV's flying path to land and dynamically get recharged on the bus. The latter module optimized the delivery progress in a multi-UAV, multi-parcel, and multi-bus scenario.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are already being applied in various fields, such as agriculture, surveying, and logistics, can be applied to automate this task. Image processing and machine learning techniques applied on images obtained from UAVs can automate Convallaria keiskei classification, help to estimate the increase in colony numbers, and reduce the detection cost.

Given LE-UAVs' advantages of wide coverage, strong versatility and low cost, in addition to logistics distribution, they are widely used in military reconnaissance, communication relay, disaster monitoring and other activities. With limited autonomous intelligence, LE-UAVs require regular periodic and non-periodic control from ground control resources (GCRs) during flights and mission execution. However, the lack of GCRs significantly restricts the applications of LEUAVs in parallel. Design/methodology/approach - We consider the constraints of GCRs, investigating an integrated optimization problem of multi-LE-UAV mission planning and GCR allocation (Multi-U&G IOP). The problem integrates GCR allocation into traditional multi-UAV cooperative mission planning. The coupling decision of mission planning and GCR allocation enlarges the decision space and adds complexities to the problem's structure. Through characterizing the problem, this study establishes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the integrated optimization problem. To solve the problem, we develop a three- stage iterative optimization algorithm combining a hybrid genetic algorithm with local search-variable neighborhood decent, heuristic conflict elimination and post-optimization of GCR allocation. Findings - Numerical experimental results show that our developed algorithm can solve the problem efficiently and exceeds the solution performance of the solver CPLEX. For small-scale instances, our algorithm can obtain optimal solutions in less time than CPLEX. For large-scale instances, our algorithm produces better results in one hour than CPLEX does. Implementing our approach allows efficient coordination of multiple UAVs, enabling faster mission completion with a minimal number of GCRs. Originality/value - Drawing on the interplay between LE-UAVs and GCRs and considering the practical applications of LE-UAVs, we propose the Multi-U&G IOP problem. We formulate this problem as a MILP model aiming to minimize the maximum task completion time (makespan). Furthermore, we present a relaxation model for this problem.

However, regulations limiting drone operations to visual line of sight (VLOS) seriously affect the design of surveys, as flight paths must be concentrated within small sampling blocks. Such a design is inferior to spatially unrestricted randomized designs available if operations beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) are allowed. We used computer simulations to assess whether the VLOS rule affects the accuracy and precision of wildlife density estimates derived from drone collected data. We tested two alternative flight plans (VLOS vs. BVLOS) in simulated surveys of low-, medium- and high-density populations of a hypothetical ungulate species with three levels of effort (one to three repetitions). The population density was estimated using the ratio estimate and distance sampling method. The observed differences in the accuracy and precision of estimates from the VLOS and BVLOS surveys were relatively small and negligible. Only in the case of the low-density population (2 ind./100 ha) surveyed once was the VLOS design inferior to BVLOS, delivering biased and less precise estimates. These results show that while the VLOS regulations complicate survey logistics and interfere with random survey design, the quality of derived estimates does not have to be compromised.

Discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based trackers have become a popular choice in the UAV tracking community owing to their ability to provide superior efficiency while consuming fewer resources.

We carried out surveys in the 2016 ablation season and compared point clouds generated from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey, close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS).

An NLME to fit the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on over-segmented UAV-imagery of a cassava experimental field is presented. To study the parameters' variability and error propagation, a resampling analysis and posterior NLME fit for different sample sizes were performed. High-resolution multispectral images (7 cm resolution) were captured in a cassava experimental field sown under optimal production conditions. NDVI for individual plants was dynamically calculated by performing a supervised classification based on over-segmented remote images using the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm for near infra-red-red-green bands. A three-parameter logistic function was adopted as a growth curve in function of growing degree days (degrees C) and fitted with an NLME approach. Inherent cassava NDVI variability due to pixel discretization, plant architecture and cassava growth was found. On average, NDVI values ranged from 0.35 to 0.40 for first development stages (295, 340 and 372 degrees C days) until 0.77 for maturity (1606 degrees C days). NDVI plant variability was correctly addressed considering the three parameters as random effects showing small root-mean-square error. Resampling analysis proved that a suitable accuracy parameter estimation can be performed with fewer individuals (plants) which might represent an agricultural experimental design with fewer experimental units. While the application of UAV imaging and nonlinear mixed models in determining NDVI curves is a relevant methodological framework, further research towards the optimization of experiment sample size is required.

{"text": "Title: Combining UAV-based hyperspectral and LiDAR data for mangrove species classification using the rotation forest algorithm Abstract: Accurate and timely monitoring of mangrove species information is crucial for precise management and practical conservation. Conventional hyperspectral techniques employed in mangrove monitoring are often limited to achieve the fine classification of mangrove species, due to the low spatial resolution of space-borne images and the high cost of airborne images. Moreover, using the spectral information alone is not adequate for fine-scale classification of mangrove species in complex ecosystems, because the spectral discriminability of mangrove species is generally restricted by complex canopy structures. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel mangrove species classification method that integratively uses unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based Nano-hyperspec hyperspectral imagery, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and the rotation forest (RoF) ensemble learning algorithm. The proposed method was tested in China's largest artificially planted mangroves, Qi'ao Island. First, we extracted spectral features from UAV-based hyperspectral data and structural information from LiDAR data; then we utilized the RoF algorithm to classify mangrove species based on the spectral and structural features and compared with two other popular ensemble learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF) and logistic model tree (LMT). Results showed that the combined hyperspectral and LiDAR data produced satisfactory results for all three classifiers with overall accuracy (OA) higher than 95%, and the proposed method achieved the highest OA of 97.22% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9686. Our study proved that incorporating the canopy height information can improve the classification accuracy, with the OA and Kappa coefficient being 2.43% and 0.0274 higher than using the original spectral bands alone, respectively. It is also found that the RoF algorithm is more accurate and stable in classifying mangrove species than those of RF and LMT. These findings indicated that the proposed approach could achieve fine-scale mangrove monitoring and further facilitate mangrove forest restoration and management. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Based on Fusion-Multiactor-Attention-Critic for Multiple-Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle Navigation Control Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has spawned a variety of intelligent services, where efficient coordination plays a significant role in increasing the effectiveness of cooperative execution. However, due to the limited operational time and range of UAVs, achieving highly efficient coordinated actions is difficult, particularly in unknown dynamic environments. This paper proposes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based fusion-multiactor-attention-critic (F-MAAC) model for multiple UAVs' energy-efficient cooperative navigation control. The proposed model is built on the multiactor-attention-critic (MAAC) model, which offers two significant advances. The first is the sensor fusion layer, which enables the actor network to utilize all required sensor information effectively. Next, a layer that computes the dissimilarity weights of different agents is added to compensate for the information lost through the attention layer of the MAAC model. We utilize the UAV LDS (logistic delivery service) environment created by the Unity engine to train the proposed model and verify its energy efficiency. The feature that measures the total distance traveled by the UAVs is incorporated with the UAV LDS environment to validate the energy efficiency. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, the F-MAAC model is compared with several conventional reinforcement learning models with two use cases. First, we compare the F-MAAC model to the DDPG, MADDPG, and MAAC models based on the mean episode rewards for 20k episodes of training. The two top-performing models (F-MAAC and MAAC) are then chosen and retrained for 150k episodes. Our study determines the total amount of deliveries done within the same period and the total amount done within the same distance to represent energy efficiency. According to our simulation results, the F-MAAC model outperforms the MAAC model, making 38% more deliveries in 3000 time steps and 30% more deliveries per 1000 m of distance traveled.

In this study, we develop an optimization model to optimize the logistics for a fleet of drones for timely delivery of medical items (e.g., medicines, test kits, and vaccines) to hard-to-access locations (i.e., rural and suburban areas). We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand loca-tions. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments is performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY.

The scheme offers 5G-tactile internet (5G-TI) based services for UAV communication networks (UAVCN) monitored through ground controller stations (GCs). 5G-TI enabled UAVCN supports real-time dense connectivity at ultra-low round-trip time (RTT) latency of < 1 ms and high availability of 99.99999%. Thus, it can support resilient vaccine distributions in a phased manner at government-designated nodal centers (NCs) with reduced round trip delays from vaccine production warehouses (VPW). Further, UAVCNs ensure minimizes human intervention and controls vaccine health conditions due to shorter trip times. Once vaccines are supplied at NCs warehouses, then the BC ensures timestamped documentation of vaccinated persons with chronology, auditability, and transparency of supply-chain checkpoints from VPW to NCs. Through smart contracts (SCs), priority groups can be formed for vaccination based on age, healthcare workers, and general commodities. In the simulation, for UAV efficacy, we have compared the scheme against fourth-generation (4G)-assisted long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, and traditional logistics for round-trip time (RTT) latency, logistics, and communication costs. In the BC setup, we have compared the scheme against the existing 5G-TI delivery scheme (Gupta et al.) for processing latency, packet losses, and transaction time. For example, in communication costs, the proposed scheme achieves an average improvement of 9.13 for block meta-information. For 4000 transactions, the proposed scheme has a communication latency of 16 s compared to 36 s. The packet loss is significantly reduced to 2.5% using 5G-TI compared to 16% in 4G-LTE-A. The proposed scheme has a computation cost of 1.6 ms and a communication cost of 157 bytes, which indicates the scheme efficacy against conventional approaches. ", "label": "True"}

Traditional transect and helicopter counts are useful for obtaining population estimates, but they often have logistical and cost limitations. The recent proliferation of drone technology offers an innovative way of surveying animal populations. However, data collected from drones are hindered by an analysis bottleneck that increases the time needed to process them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an emerging category of deep learning that can automate this data analysis process. Here, we compare traditional methods with drone surveys, by detecting and counting Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) and common hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibious). We evaluate the utility of CNNs for object detection and quantification in complex environments. Drone counts were more accurate than traditional methods; identifying 21% more crocodiles. Where vegetation was open, hippo counts with a drone showed a similar pattern (identifying 43% more). When vegetation was dense the drone produced less-accurate population estimates than traditional methods. CNN accuracy was limited (85%) due to the reduced training dataset available for the CNN. However, with an expanded data set, object detection is likely to be more accurate, making it more applicable for expedited and automated data analysis. ", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Research on Public Air Route Network Planning of Urban Low-Altitude Logistics Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow and road traffic congestion worsens, traditional ground logistics has become less efficient. This has led to longer logistics times and increased costs. Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) logistics has become increasingly popular. However, free-planned routes cannot meet the safety and efficiency requirements of urban airspace mobility. To address this issue, a public air route network for low-altitude logistics UAVs needs to be established in urban areas. This paper proposes a public route network planning method based on the obstacle-based Voronoi diagram and A* algorithm, as follows: Firstly, construct a city airspace grid model in which the characteristics of the airspace are mapped onto the grid map. Introduce an obstacle clustering algorithm based on DBSCAN to generate representative obstacle points as the Voronoi seed nodes. Utilize the Voronoi diagram to establish the initial route network. Then, conduct an improved path planning by employing the A* algorithm for obstacle avoidance in route edges that pass through obstacles. To ensure the safe operation of drones, set constraints on the route safety interval. This process will generate a low-altitude public air route network for urban areas. After considering the flight costs of logistics UAVs at different altitudes, the height for the route network layout is determined. Finally, the route network evaluation indicators are established. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the city road network planning method and the central radial network planning method, the total route length is shortened by 7.1% and 9%, respectively, the airspace coverage is increased by 9.8% and 35%, respectively, the average network degree is reduced by 52.6% and 212%, respectively, and the average flight time is reduced by 19.4s and 3.7s, respectively. In addition, by solving the network model using the Dijkstra algorithm, when the energy cost and risk cost weights are 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, and the safety interval is taken as 15 m, the total path cost value of the planned trajectory is minimized.

Drone-based distribution is an emerging solution investigated in this study to transport packages from a land base to the islands. Considering the drone costs, drone landing platforms in islands, and incorporation into the island ground distribution system, this study categorizes the direct, point-to-point, and cyclic bi-stage distribution modes: in the direct mode, the packages are distributed from the drone base station to the customers directly by drones; in the point-to-point mode, the packages are transported to the drone landing platform and then distributed to the customers independently; in the cyclic mode, the packages are distributed from a drone landing platform by a closed route. The modes are formulated, and evaluation metrics and solution methods are developed. In the experiments based on an island case, the models and solution methods are demonstrated, compared, and analyzed.

{"text": "Title: An Improved Human Evolution Optimization Algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 3D Trajectory Planning Abstract: To address the challenges of slow convergence speed, poor convergence precision, and getting stuck in local optima for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) three-dimensional path planning, this paper proposes a path planning method based on an Improved Human Evolution Optimization Algorithm (IHEOA). First, a mathematical model is used to construct a three-dimensional terrain environment, and a multi-constraint path cost model is established, framing path planning as a multidimensional function optimization problem. Second, recognizing the sensitivity of population diversity to Logistic Chaotic Mapping in a traditional Human Evolution Optimization Algorithm (HEOA), an opposition-based learning strategy is employed to uniformly initialize the population distribution, thereby enhancing the algorithm's global optimization capability. Additionally, a guidance factor strategy is introduced into the leader role during the development stage, providing clear directionality for the search process, which increases the probability of selecting optimal paths and accelerates the convergence speed. Furthermore, in the loser update strategy, an adaptive t-distribution perturbation strategy is utilized for its small mutation amplitude, which enhances the local search capability and robustness of the algorithm. Evaluations using 12 standard test functions demonstrate that these improvement strategies effectively enhance convergence precision and algorithm stability, with the IHEOA, which integrates multiple strategies, performing particularly well. Experimental comparative research on three different terrain environments and five traditional algorithms shows that the IHEOA not only exhibits excellent performance in terms of convergence speed and precision but also generates superior paths while demonstrating exceptional global optimization capability and robustness in complex environments. These results validate the significant advantages of the proposed improved algorithm in effectively addressing UAV path planning challenges. ", "label": "True"}

{"text": "Title: Comparison of UAV and Boat Surveys for Detecting Changes in Breeding Population Dynamics of Sea Turtles Abstract: Surveying the breeding population of a given species can be difficult for many logistic reasons. Marine turtles are a challenging taxon for the study of reproductive ecology and breeding strategies, because turtles aggregate off-shore and males remain exclusively at sea. For successful management of sea turtle populations, determining operational sex ratios (OSRs) on a continuing basis is critical for determining long-term population viability, particularly in the context of changing hatchling sex ratios due to temperature-dependent sex determination in a warming climate. To understand how survey technique and stage of the breeding season might influence the ability to detect turtles and determine OSRs, we surveyed the presence and identified the sex of adult male and female green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) using a boat and small commercial unoccupied/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), at the start (October) and peak (December) of a nesting season at an important breeding site at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The ratio of males to females within the breeding ground detected by both survey methods changed from being male-biased in October to heavily female-biased in December, indicating that most males cease their reproductive effort and depart before the peak of the nesting season. Surveying with a UAV more than doubled the rate of turtles seen per minute of survey effort compared with surveying solely from the boat and allowed surveys to be conducted at times and/or places unsafe or inaccessible for boats. The sex of a slightly greater proportion of turtles seen could not be identified by observers using a UAV versus a boat, although more turtles were detected using the UAV. The departure of many males during the peak of the nesting season is likely due to an increasing biological cost of residency in the area because males encounter fewer receptive females as the season progresses and the limited foraging opportunity is insufficient to support the number of males present. Overall, we found that UAVs are an effective tool for studying important but difficult to observe aspects of sea turtle biology. ", "label": "False"}

While traditional surveys are relatively inexpensive and meet current data requirements, their annual coverage of over 1 million hectares in British Columbia alone are operationally and logistically intensive. To improve the efficiency and utility of forest regeneration inventories, the incorporation of multi-temporal monitoring linked to years since planting (YSP) could help improve understanding of rates and characteristics of vegetative succession while providing a means to evaluate the economic and operational success of management actions on public land. In this study, we evaluate the potential of utilizing Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-acquired very high spatial resolution imagery to provide spatial, spectral, and structural information on forest regeneration in previously clear-cut stands near Nakusp and Quesnel, British Columbia, Canada. Three stands approximately 5, 10, and 15 YSP were chosen at both sites. Using wall-to-wall UAS-acquired red-green-blue (RGB) imagery, dense Digital Aerial Photogrammetric (DAP) point clouds were produced providing forest structure information. Spectral data in the form of Visible Vegetation Indices (VVI) including the Normalized Green Red Difference Index(NGRDI), visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI(g)), and Green Leaf Indices (GLI(x)) were computed. Spectral and structural information from the VVI and DAP were combined to perform Object-Based Image Analyses (OBIA) facilitating supervised classifications of forest cover into conifer, deciduous, and ground classes. Independent classifications were performed on each stand, yielding high overall accuracies (86-95% for Nakusp; 93-95% for Quesnel).

Height and area coverage of conifers were found to increase with YSP in both sites (0.7-2.7m for Nakusp; 0.3-2.2m for Quesnel), while VVI metrics were shown to be more successful than standard RGB at differentiating forest cover through time. The results of this study indicate that UAS-acquired imagery has a potential niche for quickly, accurately, and reliably providing highly detailed spatial, spectral, and structural information on forest regeneration.

{"text": "Title: Joint Ground and Aerial Package Delivery Services: A Stochastic Optimization Approach Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, have emerged as a promising mode of fast, energy-efficient, and cost-effective package delivery. A considerable number of works have studied different aspects of drone package delivery service by a supplier, one of which is delivery planning. However, existing works addressing the planning issues consider a simple case of perfect delivery without service interruption, e.g., due to accident, which is common and realistic. Therefore, this paper introduces the joint ground and aerial delivery service optimization and planning (GADOP) framework. The framework explicitly incorporates uncertainty of drone package delivery, i.e., takeoff and breakdown conditions. The GADOP framework aims to minimize the total delivery cost, given practical constraints, e.g., travelling distance limit. Specifically, we formulate the GADOP framework as a three-stage stochastic integer programming model. To deal with the high complexity issue of the problem, a decomposition method is adopted. Then, the performance of the GADOP framework is evaluated by using two data sets including the Solomon benchmark suite and the real data from one of the Singapore logistics companies. The performance evaluation clearly shows that the GADOP framework can achieve significantly lower total payment than that of the baseline methods, which do not take uncertainty into account.

This paper provides the first investigation of SfM as a tool for mapping fault zone topography in areas of sparse or low-lying vegetation. First, we present a simple, affordable SfM workflow, based on an unmanned helium balloon or motorized glider, an inexpensive camera, and semiautomated software. Second, we illustrate the system at two sites on southern California faults covered by existing airborne or terrestrial LiDAR, enabling a comparative assessment of SfM topography resolution and precision. At the first site, an similar to 0.1 km(2) alluvial fan on the San Andreas fault, a colored point cloud of density mostly >700 points/m(2) and a 3 cm digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto were produced from 233 photos collected similar to 50 m above ground level. When a few global positioning system ground control points are incorporated, closest point vertical distances to the much sparser (similar to 4 points/m(2)) airborne LiDAR point cloud are mostly <3 cm. The second site spans an similar to 1 km section of the 1992 Landers earthquake scarp. A colored point cloud of density mostly >530 points/m(2) and a 2 cm DEM and orthophoto were produced from 450 photos taken from similar to 60 m above ground level. Closest point vertical distances to existing terrestrial LiDAR data of comparable density are mostly <6 cm. Each SfM survey took similar to 2 h to complete and several hours to generate the scene topography and texture.

Remote medical support, commodities transportation within due time, live-action movies, cinematography, distant communication support, and many other provisions are provided by drones right now. However, the selection of drones for a particular job is quite sensitive and not all drones are feasible for any job. In this case, we need to scientifically assess and confirm drone performance in logistics and transportation. In this study, we present a Bayesian Network (BN) approach to predict the overall performance of drone technology through four prime criteria (factors), namely: physical specification, technical responses, functional performance, and economic cost. To that end, we have developed a Bayesian network approach to portray the causal relationships between the various factors that affect drone selection based on their performance, and subsequently, predicted the posterior probability of drone performance conditioned upon the aforementioned salient criteria. To evaluate the model further, a number of analyses, such as Bayesian inference algorithm (belief propagation) and sensitivity analyses have been carried out. The results show that when the physical specification criteria are met, the economic factor is most imperious to the overall performance of the drone, followed by functional performance and technical responsiveness. This research would invoke richer dialogue for the researchers and practitioners to select and use suitable drones and develop subsequent policies for different transportation scenarios under uncertainty.

Abstract: As international humanitarian assistance from governments and private donors continued to increase in recent years, the pace of growth, however, has slowed down [1]. For instance, in 2018, while US $ 17.0 billion out of US $ 28.1 billion funding was committed to UN-coordinated appeals, there was still a funding shortfall of US $ 11.1 billion, with only 61% of requirements met [1]. Against this backdrop, international organizations are in - creasingly implementing innovative solutions to respond the needs of affected communities [2], [3]. Many of these solutions involve the use of digital technologies, such as geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, spatial decision support systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones [4]. Although drones are not the first use of robotics in commercial and industrial settings, the humanitarian use of drones represents the first wave of robotics applied in the aid sector, and is representative of emerging technologies being used for humanitarian purposes [5]. Examples of successful drone use in this setting include the 2010 Haiti earthquake (damage inspection), 2012 Hurricane Sandy in the U.S.A.

However, the existing studies often overlook the dynamic nature of customer demands and wind conditions, limiting the practical applicability of their proposed strategies. To tackle this challenge, we firstly construct a time-slicing-based UAV path planning model that incorporates dynamic customer demands and wind impacts. Based on this model, a two-stage logistics UAV path planning framework is developed according to the analysis of the customer pool updates and dynamic attitudes. Secondly, a dynamic demand and wind-aware logistics UAV path planning problem is formulated to minimize the weighted average of the energy consumption and the customer satisfaction penalty cost, which comprehensively takes the energy consumption constraints, load weight constraints, and hybrid time window constraints into consideration. To solve this problem, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based multiple logistics UAV path planning algorithm is developed, which has good performance with fast convergence and better solutions. Finally, extensive simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can not only adhere to the UAV's maximum load and battery power constraints but also significantly enhance the loading efficiency and battery utilization rate. Particularly, compared to the genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), and traditional PSO strategies, our proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory solutions within a reasonable time frame and reduces the distribution costs by up to 9.82%.

However, hydrogen storage faces challenges, including low volumetric density, fire and explosion risks and transport challenges. We assessed over fifteen hydrogen carriers based on their maritime performance characteristics to determine their suitability for shipboard use. Evaluation criteria included energy density, locally zero-emission, circularity of process, safety, dehydrogenation process, logistic availability and handling. Thus, excluding ammonia and methanol because of these constraints, we found that borohydrides, liquid organic hydrogen carriers and ammoniaborane are the most promising hydrogen carriers to use on ships with PEM fuel cells. Borohydrides, specifically sodium borohydride, have high energy densities but face regeneration issues. The liquid organic hydrogen carrier dibenzyltoluene has a lower energy density but exhibits easy hydrogenation and good handling. Given varying operational demands, we developed a framework to assess the suitability of hydrogen carriers for use in different ship categories. Evaluating the three types of hydrogen carriers, using our framework and considering current practices, shows that these are viable options for almost all ship types.

{"text": "Title: A Quantum-Resistant Identity Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for UAV Networks Based on Kyber Algorithm Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a critical role in various fields, including logistics, agriculture, and rescue operations. Effective identity authentication and key agreement schemes are vital for UAV networks to combat threats. Current schemes often employ algorithms like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address this issue, we propose LIGKYX, a novel scheme combining the quantum-resistant Kyber algorithm with the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for enhanced security and efficiency. This scheme enables the mutual authentication between UAVs and ground stations and supports secure session key establishment protocols. Additionally, it facilitates robust authentication and key agreement among UAVs through control stations, addressing the critical challenge of quantum-resistant security in UAV networks. The proposed LIGKYX scheme operates based on the Kyber algorithm and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol, employing the HMAC and pre-computation techniques. Furthermore, a formal verification tool validated the security of LIGKYX under the Dolev-Yao threat model. Comparative analyses on security properties, communication overhead, and computational overhead indicate that LIGKYX not only matches or exceeds existing schemes but also uniquely counters quantum attacks effectively, ensuring the security of UAV communication networks with a lower time overhead for authentication and communication.

With the emergence of edge computing, IoT devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can process data instantly at the point of generation, which significantly decreases the requirement for on-board processing power and minimises the data transfer time to enable real-time applications. Meanwhile, with federated learning (FL), UAVs can enhance their intelligent decision-making capabilities by learning from other UAVs without directly accessing their data. This facilitates rapid model iteration and improvement while safeguarding data privacy. However, in many UAV applications such as UAV logistics, different UAVs may perform different tasks and cover different areas, which can result in heterogeneous data and add to the problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data for model training. To address such a problem, we introduce a novel cloud-edge-end collaborative FL framework, which organises and combines local clients through clustering and aggregation. By employing the cosine similarity, we identified and integrated the most appropriate local model into the global model, which can effectively address the issue of Non-IID data in UAV logistics.

How to rationally plan multiple UAVs to quickly complete the emergency logistics tasks in many disaster-stricken areas has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, an optimization model is established with the goal of minimizing the task completion time and the penalty cost of advance/delay, and a discrete multi-objective teaching-learning-based optimization (DMOTLBO) algorithm is proposed.

We employed the Navier-Stokes solver to numerically simulate steady, incompressible flow conditions. By examining the effects of key design parameters on aerodynamic characteristics and bypass flow fields in a two-dimensional state, we were able to suggest a more optimized foldable wing design. Building on the two-dimensional analysis, we performed aerodynamic assessments of the three-dimensional aircraft geometry. Our results indicated that appropriate wing and gap parameters can significantly enhance lift characteristics, maintaining high lift even during large-angle flights. Specifically, when compared to a mono-wing, the lift coefficient of the bi-wing increased by 27.1% at a 14 degrees angle of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of our wing-and-gap design. Optimal aerodynamic performance was achieved when the gap distance equalled the chord length in both flow and vertical directions. Further, the right combination of airfoil configuration, wing axes angle, and wingspan can improve flow field aerodynamic characteristics, while also enhancing the wing's stall capacity. The lift coefficient reached its maximum value at an angle of attack of 15 degrees, which has the potential to reduce takeoff and landing distances, thereby enhancing the UAV's overall safety.

{"text": "Title: Efficient Schedule of Energy-Constrained UAV Using Crowdsourced Buses in Last-Mile Parcel Delivery Abstract: Stimulated by the dramatical service demand in the logistics industry, logistics trucks employed in last-mile parcel delivery bring critical public concerns, such as heavy cost burden, traffic congestion and air pollution. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a promising alternative tool in last-mile delivery, which is however limited by insufficient flight range and load capacity. This paper presents an innovative energy-limited logistics UAV schedule approach using crowdsourced buses. Specifically, when one UAV delivers a parcel, it first lands on a crowdsourced social bus to parcel destination, gets recharged by the wireless recharger deployed on the bus, and then flies from the bus to the parcel destination. This novel approach not only increases the delivery range and load capacity of battery-limited UAVs, but is also much more cost-effective and environment-friendly than traditional methods. New challenges therefore emerge as the buses with spatiotemporal mobility become the bottleneck during delivery. By landing on buses, an Energy-Neutral Flight Principle and a delivery scheduling algorithm are proposed for the UAVs. Using the Energy-Neutral Flight Principle, each UAV can plan a flying path without depleting energy given buses with uncertain velocities. Besides, the delivery scheduling algorithm optimizes the delivery time and number of delivered parcels given warehouse location, logistics UAVs, parcel locations and buses. Comprehensive evaluations using a large-scale bus dataset demonstrate the superiority of the innovative logistics UAV schedule approach. ", "label": "True"}

This is due to its advantages including fast response times, energy efficiency and cost effectiveness over conventional cloud computing platforms. However, running complex computational scientific workflow tasks is still a very challenging issue at the edge, due to its typical three-layered computing environment consisting of an end device layer, an edge server layer, and a cloud server layer. A large number of recent studies have proposed different solutions for optimizing such computing resource management problems in an edge computing environment. However, since evaluation of most such studies is conducted through simulation, the effectiveness cannot be guaranteed in a real world environment. Therefore, to advance research on efficient execution and deployment problems for real world workflow applications using edge computing, an open-source edge workflow management system with comprehensive empirical evaluation capabilities is urgently required. This paper presents the first edge workflow system (named EdgeWorkflow) that is able to deploy user-created workflow applications to a real-world edge computing environment with \"one-click'' after optimizing the configuration with the simulation tool. With the aid of EdgeWorkflow, the user can automate the generation of specific edge computing environments, easily model and generate executable workflow applications with a visual modelling tool, effectively select various resource management methods included in the systems or apply their own resource management and task scheduling algorithms, efficiently monitor the statuses of computational tasks and obtain comprehensive reports on the execution results (such as those regarding time, cost and energy).

Drones have cheaper and safer logistics, however their range is generally too short for large-scale application of the traditional method. Our paper investigates an innovative rosette flight plan for wildlife census, and evaluates relevance of this sampling protocol by comparing its statistical performance with transects, based on numerical simulations. (2) The UAS flight plan consisted in two rosettes of 6 triangular '' petals '' spread across the survey area, for a theoretical sampling rate of 2.95%, as opposed to a 20.04% classic sampling protocol with systematic transects. We tested the logistics of our survey design in Garamba National Park. We then modeled theoretical population distributions for both antelopes and buffaloes. We calculated animal densities in the simulated footprints of the theoretical rosette and transect flight plans. We also tested aggregating results for 2, 3 and 4 repetitions of the same rosette flight plan to increase the sampling rate. (3) Simulation results showed that the coefficient of variation associated with density estimates decreases with the number of repetitions of the rosette flight plan, and aggregating four repetitions is enough to give antelope densities with acceptable accuracy and precision while staying at a lower sampling rate. Buffalo densities displayed much higher variability and it shows the significant impact of gregariousness on density estimate accuracy and precision. (4) The method was found to be inappropriate for highly aggregative species but efficient for species that disperse widely and more randomly in their environment.

UAVs offer substantial benefits in speed, cost, and reach, promising to revolutionize logistics, especially in remote areas. On the one hand, they are poised to meet demands for quick and versatile delivery options. On the other hand, their deployment comes with challenges. Weather variabilities such as rainfall, wind speed, and the need for safe take-off intervals can compromise UAV safety and operation. Conventional route optimization often overlooks these dynamic factors, resulting in inefficient or unworkable delivery routes. The repeated time-consuming calculations are caused by repeated trials when making UAV group distribution plans. Recognizing these gaps, this study proposes a data representation to effectively transform the flight flyable area of UAVs into a time-varying network that maintains spatiotemporal connectivity and establishes a mathematical model that represents the complexities of UAV group distribution. Then, a multistage dynamic optimization algorithm specifically tailored for large-scale time-varying network distribution route search is designed to obtain the stable and optimal solution. Subsequent experimental validations on actual case datasets have confirmed the correctness, effectiveness, and adaptability of the algorithm. Benchmarking against traditional CPLEX methods demonstrated that the algorithm not only rivals the best solutions but does so with a 38.8 times increase in computational speed.

A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to jointly optimize thethree decisions with the objective of minimizing the delivery completion time (or makespan).To handle large problem instances, we develop an optimization-enabled two-phase searchalgorithm by hybridizing simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search.

In this scenario, parcels need to be delivered to each customer point. The major feature of the problem is the combination of a fleet of road vehicles (vans) with a drone. Each van visits a subset of demand nodes to be determined according to the route of the van. The drone serves the customers not served by vans. At the same time, considering the safety, policy and terrain as well as the need to replace the battery, the drone needs to be transported by truck to the identified station along with the parcel. From each such station, the drone serves a subset of customers according to a direct assignment pattern, i.e., every time the drone is launched, it serves one demand node and returns to the station to collect another parcel. Similarly, the truck is used to transport the drone and cargo between stations. This is somewhat different from the research of other scholars. In terms of the joint distribution of the drone and road vehicle, most scholars will choose the combination of two transportation tools, while we use three. The drone and vans are responsible for distribution services, and the trucks are responsible for transporting the goods and drone to the station. The goal is to optimize the total delivery cost which includes the transportation costs for the vans and the delivery cost for the drone. A fixed cost is also considered for each drone parking site corresponding to the cost of positioning the drone and using the drone station. A discrete optimization model is presented for the problem in addition to a two-phase heuristic algorithm. The results of a series of computational tests performed to assess the applicability of the model and the efficiency of the heuristic are reported. The results obtained show that nearly 10% of the cost can be saved by combining the traditional delivery mode with the use of a drone and drone stations. ", "label": "True"}

When two drones meet each other, they exchange the high weighted packets.

So far, only large passenger aircraft, a few general aviation aircraft, and specialized rotorcraft are equipped with ice protection systems because of their additional energy consumption and weight. The emerging markets of small electric aircraft like Urban Air Mobility and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for transportation, logistics, search and rescue, and other specialized operations will require efficient, lightweight and all-electric ice protection systems in order to allow operations in ice and snow conditions. In this work, an electrothermal ice protection system with an average heat power density of 1 W cm-2 was designed and developed for use on small multirotor drones. Commercially available propeller blades with diameters of 33 cm were retrofitted with lightweight multilayer heating foils independently powered by super-capacitors. The heated propellers were tested in close-to-real icing conditions in a small-scale icing wind tunnel. Thrust, rotational speed, and power consumption of a non-heated reference propeller and a heated propeller were compared. In glaze ice conditions at air temperatures > -5 degrees C the thrust of the non-heated propeller fluctuated between 60 and 90% with frequent cycles of ice accretion and shedding for the entire duration of the test. The heated propeller maintained a thrust of >95% in the same icing conditions. In rime ice conditions at air temperatures < -8 <degrees>C the heating was not sufficient and the thrust of the non-heated and heated propellers similarly decreased over time. Heat flux calculations along the span of the propeller were made for different icing conditions and compared to the heat power density distribution of the tested ice protection system.

{"text": "Title: Identification of Urban Air Logistics Distribution Network Concepts Abstract: This study attempts to identify urban air logistics (UAL) operational concepts by synthesizing the urban freight transport (UFT) network configurations and urban air mobility (UAM) characteristics. UAL is gaining popularity as a quick and safe mode that has the potential to address several logistics challenges. This study has reviewed scientific papers identified using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to understand the features of existing UFT distribution networks, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and UAM. The cross analysis considered UFT features such as the parcel's weight, delivery type (time sensitivity, customer-to-customer, business-to-consumer, or business-to-business), and UFT distribution network types and compared them against the features of UAS such as maximum take-off weight, range, and infrastructure requirements (drone ports). The analysis identified three types of UAL operational concepts: door-to-door direct (D2DD), hybrid, and multimodal. Lightweight deliveries can be operated using D2DD and hybrid through point-to-point (P-P) and extended P-P network concepts. The hybrid concept uses an intermediate drop-off location to deliver goods. Hub-and-spoke (H-S), extended H-S, and trunk line with collecting/distribution network designs can be used for heavyweight cargo operations. D2DD versus hybrid/multimodal concepts were compared based on six thematic clusters (societal implications, safety and security, ethics, environmental issues, public acceptance, and urban planning and infrastructure). This study identified that technological development and innovation could reduce social implications and ethical challenges. Furthermore, public willingness and economic feasibility will determine the success of the operational concepts. The identified UAL operational concepts, network designs, and challenges will help to conduct further research in this subject area. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Battery Electric Vehicle Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone Abstract: The idea of deploying electric vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, to deliver packages in logistics operations has attracted increasing attention in the past few years. In this paper, we propose an innovative problem where a battery electric vehicle (BEV) paired with drone is utilized to deliver first-aid items in a rural area. This problem is termed battery electric vehicle traveling salesman problem with drone (BEVTSPD). In BEVTSPD, the BEV and the drone perform delivery tasks coordinately while the BEV can serve as a drone hub. The BEV can also refresh its battery energy to full capacity in battery-swap stations available in the network. An arc-based mixed-integer programming model defined in a multigraph is presented for BEVTSPD. An exact branch-and-price (BP) algorithm and a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) heuristic are developed to solve instances with up to 25 customers in one minute. Numerical experiments show that the heuristic is much more efficient than solving the arc-based model using the ILOG CPLEX solver and BP algorithm. A real-world case study and the sensitivity analysis of different parameters are also conducted and presented. The results indicate that drone speed has a more significant effect on delivery time than the BEV's driving range. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Managing price and fleet size for courier service with shared drones Abstract: With the rapid development of modern logistics systems, the unmanned aerial vehicle (a.k.a. drone) based delivery service emerges as a technology-driven innovation, and it is now pilot running in many regions across the globe. The drone delivery system aims to reduce the labor cost in the current laborintensive courier industry, as well as avoid the disturbance caused by geographic and demographic features. For the drone delivery service providers to survive and prosper, a pool of shared drones is integrated into the ecological chain, where the courier service providers focus on the delivery operations. For such a drone sharing system, revenue management becomes vital in terms of pricing, drone hiring cost, and service-related cost. To better depict the system dynamics, in the present paper, a time-varying and price-sensitive queueing model is formulated, where the customer behaviors are taken into account, such as balking and abandonment. To guarantee a preset service level, the probability of abandonment and expected delay are considered as the control targets, and the pricing for courier service and the maintained fleet size are considered simultaneously. For the low and moderate quality of service(QoS) target, a fluid control model is constructed with a closed-form solution. For the high QoS target, a modified approximation algorithm is designed to numerically tackle the problem. Based on the simulation, it is observed that the proposed approximation methods not only provide a high-quality joint strategy but also help stabilize the system performance. In addition, only mild price change is needed to reach the optimal condition, and a time lag exists between the optimal fleet sizing and the demand variation, which may shed light on the demand-driven fleet sizing under more general settings.

Socio-economic activities in the coastal and marine Arctic are simultaneously changing. This calls for the establishment of a marine Arctic component of the Pan-Eurasian Experiment (MA-PEEX). There is a need for more in situ observations on the marine atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean, but increasing the amount of such observations is a pronounced technological and logistical challenge. The SMEAR (Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations) concept can be applied in coastal and archipelago stations, but in the Arctic Ocean it will probably be more cost-effective to further develop a strongly distributed marine observation network based on autonomous buoys, moorings, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These have to be supported by research vessel and aircraft campaigns, as well as various coastal observations, including community-based ones. Major manned drift-ing stations may occasionally be comparable to terrestrial SMEAR flagship stations. To best utilize the observations, atmosphere-ocean reanalyses need to be further developed. To well integrate MA-PEEX with the existing terrestrialatmospheric PEEX, focus is needed on the river discharge and associated fluxes, coastal processes, and atmospheric transports in and out of the marine Arctic. More observations and research are also needed on the specific socioeconomic challenges and opportunities in the marine and coastal Arctic, and on their interaction with changes in the climate and environmental system. MA-PEEX will promote international collaboration; sustainable marine meteorological, sea ice, and oceanographic observations; advanced data management; and multidisciplinary research on the marine Arctic and its interaction with the Eurasian continent.

{"text": "Title: 3D Tree Dimensionality Assessment Using Photogrammetry and Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Abstract: Detailed, precise, three-dimensional (3D) representations of individual trees are a prerequisite for an accurate assessment of tree competition, growth, and morphological plasticity. Until recently, our ability to measure the dimensionality, spatial arrangement, shape of trees, and shape of tree components with precision has been constrained by technological and logistical limitations and cost. Traditional methods of forest biometrics provide only partial measurements and are labor intensive. Active remote technologies such as LiDAR operated from airborne platforms provide only partial crown reconstructions. The use of terrestrial LiDAR is laborious, has portability limitations and high cost. In this work we capitalized on recent improvements in the capabilities and availability of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), light and inexpensive cameras, and developed an affordable method for obtaining precise and comprehensive 3D models of trees and small groups of trees. The method employs slow-moving UAVs that acquire images along predefined trajectories near and around targeted trees, and computer vision-based approaches that process the images to obtain detailed tree reconstructions. After we confirmed the potential of the methodology via simulation we evaluated several UAV platforms, strategies for image acquisition, and image processing algorithms. We present an original, step-by-step workflow which utilizes open source programs and original software.

{"text": "Title: KeepEdge: A Knowledge Distillation Empowered Edge Intelligence Framework for Visual Assisted Positioning in UAV Delivery Abstract: The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) delivery is being increasingly used in the field of logistics. However, it is highly challenging for a UAV to precisely identify the position for parcel delivering if it is only aided by the GPS, especially in some complex environments with weak signals and high interference. To address this issue, we present a knowledge distillation empowered edge intelligence framework, KeepEdge, to achieve visual information-assisted positioning for the last mile UAV delivery services. In our approach, we integrate deep neural networks (DNN) into an edge computing framework to enable edge intelligence which empowers the UAVs to autonomously identify the expected delivery position using visual information. Deploying the DNN model and conducting model inference on UAVs however, requires high computing performance. To manage the trade-off between the limited resources onboard the UAVs and high-performance requirements, here, we employ knowledge distillation to produce a lightweight model with high accuracy based on the full model trained in the Cloud. The lightweight model with significantly lower complexity and less inference latency is used onboard of the UAVs for accurate positioning. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory performance for assisted positioning.

{"text": "Title: CUDM: A Combined UAV Detection Model Based on Video Abnormal Behavior Abstract: The widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has brought many benefits, particularly for military and civil applications. For example, UAVs can be used in communication, ecological surveys, agriculture, and logistics to improve efficiency and reduce the required workforce. However, the malicious use of UAVs can significantly endanger public safety and pose many challenges to society. Therefore, detecting malicious UAVs is an important and urgent issue that needs to be addressed. In this study, a combined UAV detection model (CUDM) based on analyzing video abnormal behavior is proposed. CUDM uses abnormal behavior detection models to improve the traditional object detection process. The work of CUDM can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, our model cuts the video into images and uses the abnormal behavior detection model to remove a large number of useless images, improving the efficiency and real-time detection of suspicious targets. In the second stage, CUDM works to identify whether the suspicious target is a UAV or not. Besides, CUDM relies only on ordinary equipment such as surveillance cameras, avoiding the use of expensive equipment such as radars. A self-made UAV dataset was constructed to verify the reliability of CUDM. The results show that CUDM not only maintains the same accuracy as state-of-the-art object detection models but also reduces the workload by 32%. Moreover, it can detect malicious UAVs in real-time.

The main idea of the 3D UAV path planning problem is how to plan to get an optimal flight path while ensuring that the UAV does not collide with obstacles during flight. This paper transforms the 3D UAV path planning problem into a multi-constrained optimization problem by formulating the path length cost function, the safety cost function, the flight altitude cost function and the smoothness cost function. This paper encodes each feasible flight path as a set of vectors consisting of magnitude, elevation and azimuth angles and searches for the optimal flight path in the configuration space by means of a metaheuristic algorithm. Subsequently, this paper proposes an improved tuna swarm optimization algorithm based on a sigmoid nonlinear weighting strategy, multi-subgroup Gaussian mutation operator and elite individual genetic strategy, called SGGTSO. Finally, the SGGTSO algorithm is compared with some other classical and novel metaheuristics in a 3D UAV path planning problem with nine different terrain scenarios and in the CEC2017 test function set. The comparison results show that the flight path planned by the SGGTSO algorithm significantly outperforms other comparison algorithms in nine different terrain scenarios, and the optimization performance of SGGTSO outperforms other comparison algorithms in 24 CEC2017 test functions.

Mapping of the different types of damages caused by the disease is challenging in high density ecosystems in which spectral variability is high due to canopy heterogeneity. Data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be particularly useful for such tasks due to the high resolution, flexibility of acquisition and cost efficiency of this type of data. In this study, A. glutinosa decline was assessed by considering four categories of tree health status in the field: asymptomatic, dead and defoliation above and below a 50% threshold. A combination of multispectral Parrot Sequoia and UAV unmanned aerial vehicles -red green blue (RGB) data were analysed using classical random forest (RF) and a simple and robust three-step logistic modelling approaches to identify the most important forest health indicators while adhering to the principle of parsimony. A total of 34 remote sensing variables were considered, including a set of vegetation indices, texture features from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital surface model (DSM), topographic and digital aerial photogrammetry-derived structural data from the DSM at crown level. Results The four categories identified by the RF yielded an overall accuracy of 67%, while aggregation of the legend to three classes (asymptomatic, defoliated, dead) and to two classes (alive, dead) improved the overall accuracy to 72% and 91% respectively. On the other hand, the confusion matrix, computed from the three logistic models by using the leave-out cross-validation method yielded overall accuracies of 75%, 80% and 94% for four-, three- and two-level classifications, respectively.

In this study, a total of 26 UAV multispectral imagery acquisitions were conducted to track the growth of strawberry plants in central Florida during the winter growing season from November 2021 to March 2022. The main contributions of this work include: 1) a geospatial tool using R and Python scripts was proposed for automatic delineation of strawberry canopies from UAV orthomosaic and DSM (Digital Surface Model) images using the Marker Controlled Watershed Algorithm (MCWA), followed by extraction of canopy structural parameters from the CHM (Canopy Height Model) images. The overall detection recall rate was 96.95%, and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) rates for instance segmentation was 99.15%; 2) the growth curve of strawberry plants throughout their life cycle was investigated. A logistic function was used to fit the growth curves of strawberry plants based on the biomass estimated from CHM-derived structural parameters and vegetation indexes (VIs). Wide variability in the shape of growth curves was found among a collection of over 400 varieties and breeding selections.

Eighty relevant papers published between 2015-2020 are included. This review evaluates the quality of each model through the newly developed AAODD (Autonomous vehicle Agent-based Overview, Design concepts and Details) protocol in four perspectives: model transparency, research questions, network + agent behaviour and model execution. Then, similarities and particularities of the papers are summarised based on whether AVs are used for passenger mobility or for freight logistics. The reviewed mobility papers exhibit the ABMs' applicability and flexibility for studying different AV operational patterns. We summarise the respective modelling specifications in research questions, data collections, model platforms, model executions, and scenario variations. Overall, by combining AVs with different technical possibilities and operational strategies, the simulation results illustrate that AVs would bring vast benefits to urban mobility networks. Unlike AVs' usage in passenger mobility, it is still unclear how AVs will serve future urban logistics demands. Many operational patterns, including unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous robots, autonomous trucks, and autonomous cargo-hatching vehicles coexist in the research community. The number of relevant papers remains low due to the early stage of AV technology deployment. However, ABMs also prove their applicability for analysing the macro and mesoscopic impacts of freight AV transportation on urban network. The reviewed papers suggest that implementing AVs for urban logistics is more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional delivery vehicles. Overall, ABMs are a powerful tool for simulating future urban scenarios with AVs. By calculating the average score of reviewed papers obtained via AAODD annually, we find that studies simulating AV systems in ABMs are getting more complex by combing diverse technological possibilities, supporting the simulation of more realistic future scenarios. The outcomes of reviewed ABM research reveals that AVs are a promising solution for solving current urban transport problems. Lastly, as nearly all current reviewed studies focus on AVs' usages in either mobility or logistics, research on an integrated simulation that combines AVs for both purposes has been scarcely addressed.

Notably, logistic companies have given close attention to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck, proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery routes of truck and drone. Computational experiments show the potential of the algorithm to improve significantly delivery time.

{"text": "Title: The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sample the blow microbiome of small cetaceans Abstract: Recent studies describe the use of UAVs in collecting blow samples from large whales to analyze the microbial and viral community in exhaled air. Unfortunately, attempts to collect blow from small cetaceans have not been successful due to their swimming and diving behavior. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study we investigated the application of a specific sampling tool attached to a UAV to analyze the blow from small cetaceans and their respiratory microbiome. Preliminary trials to set up the sampling tool were conducted on a group of 6 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, housed at Acquario di Genova, with approximately 1 meter distance between the blowing animal and the tool to obtain suitable samples. The same sampling kit, suspended via a 2 meter rope assembled on a waterproof UAV, flying 3 meters above the animals, was used to sample the blows of 5 wild bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia (Greece) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), to investigate whether this experimental assembly also works for large whale sampling. In order to distinguish between blow-associated microbes and seawater microbes, we pooled 5 seawater samples from the same area where blow samples' collection were carried out. The the respiratory microbiota was assessed by using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene via Illumina Amplicon Sequencing. The pooled water samples contained more bacterial taxa than the blow samples of both wild animals and the sequenced dolphin maintained under human care. The composition of the bacterial community differed between the water samples and between the blow samples of wild cetaceans and that under human care, but these differences may have been mediated by different microbial communities between seawater and aquarium water. The sperm whale's respiratory microbiome was more similar to the results obtained from wild bottlenose dolphins. Although the number of samples used in this study was limited and sampling and analyses were impaired by several limitations, the results are rather encouraging, as shown by the evident microbial differences between seawater and blow samples, confirmed also by the meta-analysis carried out comparing our results with those obtained in previous studies. Collecting exhaled air from small cetaceans using drones is a challenging process, both logistically and technically. The success in obtaining samples from small cetacean blow in this study in comparison to previous studies is likely due to the distance the sampling kit is suspended from the drone, which reduced the likelihood that the turbulence of the drone propeller interfered with successfully sampling blow, suggested as a factor leading to poor success in previous studies.

However, real-time communication with drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the IoD environment occurs over an insecure open channel, making it susceptible to various security and privacy vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data interception, denial of service attacks, and privacy concerns.

One conceivable scenario of using a drone in conjunction with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels is discussed in earlier literature and termed the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem (PDSTSP).

Integrated scheduling of multiple depots hosting a fleet of trucks and a fleet of drones is further studied to achieve an operational excellence. A vehicle that travels near the boundary of the coverage area might be more effective to serve customers that belong to the neighboring depot. This problem is uniquely modeled as an unrelated parallel machine scheduling with sequence dependent setup, precedence-relationship, and reentrant, which gives us a framework to effectively consider those operational challenges.

{"text": "Title: Optimal allocation of defibrillator drones in mountainous regions Abstract: Responding to emergencies in Alpine terrain is quite challenging as air ambulances and mountain rescue services are often confronted with logistics challenges and adverse weather conditions that extend the response times required to provide life-saving support. Among other medical emergencies, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the most time-sensitive event that requires the quick provision of medical treatment including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and electric shocks by automated external defibrillators (AED). An emerging technology called unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) is regarded to support mountain rescuers in overcoming the time criticality of these emergencies by reducing the time span between SCA and early defibrillation. A drone that is equipped with a portable AED can fly from a base station to the patient's site where a bystander receives it and starts treatment. This paper considers such a response system and proposes an integer linear program to determine the optimal allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region. In detail, the developed model follows the objectives to minimize the number of used drones and to minimize the average travel times of defibrillator drones responding to SCA patients. In an example of application, under consideration of historical helicopter response times, the authors test the developed model and demonstrate the capability of drones to speed up the delivery of AEDs to SCA patients. Results indicate that time spans between SCA and early defibrillation can be reduced by the optimal allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region, thus increasing the survival rate of SCA patients.

It is challenging to carry out research designed to plan the path of eVTOL UAVs which can have a safe and sustainable operation mode in urban areas. Therefore, this work proposes a method for planning an obstacle-free path for eVTOL UAVs in urban areas with the goal of minimizing energy consumption. It aims to improve the safety and sustainability of eVTOL UAV operations. Based on variations of air density with height, a more accurate formula for calculating battery energy consumption of eVTOL UAV is derived. It is used in the vertical takeoff and landing phase and horizontal flight phase, respectively. Considering the influence of buildings on eVTOL UAV operation, a path planning method applicable to complex urban environments is proposed. The safe nodes of eVTOL UAV flight are obtained by using Voronoi diagrams based on building locations. Then, the complete shortest and obstacle-free path is obtained by using a Dubins geometric path and Floyd algorithm. After obtaining the obstacle-free paths for all flight height zones, the battery energy consumption of the eVTOL UAV in each flight height zone is calculated. Then, the flight height with the minimum energy consumption is obtained. The simulation results show that the path length obtained by the proposed path planning method is shorter than that obtained by particle swarm optimization; the total battery energy consumption changes in the same pattern in the low-altitude areas and high-altitude areas; the difference between the maximum and minimum energy consumption in the small area enables the eVTOL UAV to cover about 350 m more, and about 420 m more in the large area. Therefore, in future high-frequency UAV mission flights, choosing the altitude with the lowest energy consumption can reduce UAV operator costs.

Metal Halide Perovskites Solar Cells (MH-PSCs) provide a transformative, low-cost solution for high-efficiency PV with diverse compositions, exceptional optoelectronic properties, and low-temperature, solution-based processability. Conventionally the MH-PSCs are fabricated in \"p-i-n\" or \"n-i-p\" configuration on glass-Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) substrates. While glass-based Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable efficiencies, their limited scalability, high areal-weight, and mechanical rigidity greatly limit their usage in wearables electronics, BIPVs, and e-mobility applications. Addressing these challenges requires \"targeted architectural innovations\" in MH-PSCs, tailored to specific applications, to drive their practical deployment forward. This study reviews four innovative PSC architectures-Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) PSCs, Lateral Configuration (LC) PSCs, Fiber-Shaped (FS) PSCs, and Substrate-Configuration (SC) PSCs-highlighting their design advancements for enhanced efficiency, flexibility, lightweight, and application-specific integration. Importantly, the review discusses the precise engineering required in each layer of these architectural innovations to ensure compatibility, efficient charge transport, durability, and scalability while optimizing performance, while also identifying key challenges and outlining directions for future R&D.

This is particularly true for 'logistically difficult species' where their cryptic natures, low abundance, patchy distributions and difficult and/or dangerous sampling environments, make traditional surveys near impossible. What results is a lack of ecological knowledge on such marine species. However, advances in UAV technology holds potential for overcoming these logistical difficulties and filling this knowledge gap. Our research focused on one such logistically difficult species, the Australian box Jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri), and we investigated the capacity of consumer grade UAV technology to detect this, highly venomous, target species in the inshore waters of Northern Queensland Australia. At two sites in the Weipa area, we utilized video analysis, visual count comparisons with a netted animal tally, and evaluated the role of associated environmental conditions, such as wind speed, water visibility and cloud cover on jellyfish detection rates. In total fifteen, 70 meter transects were completed between two sites, with 107 individuals captured. Drone success varied between the two sites with a significant difference between field and post-field (laboratory) counts. Animal size and cloud cover also had significant effects on detection rates with an increase in cloud cover and animal size enhancing detection probability. This study provides evidence to suggest drone surveys overcome obstacles that traditional surveys can't, with respect to species deemed logistically difficult and open scope for further ecological investigations on such species.

{"text": "Title: Collaborative truck multi-drone delivery system considering drone scheduling and en route operations Abstract: The integration of drones into the conventional truck delivery system has gained substantial attention in the business and academic communities. Most existing works restrict the launch and recovery of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to customer locations (or nodes) in the delivery network. Nevertheless, emerging technological advances can allow drones to autonomously launch/land from a moving vehicle. In addition, majority of the current literature assumes multiple UAVs to be deployed and/or recovered simultaneously, thereby ignoring the associated scheduling decisions, which are essential to ensure safe, collision-free operations. This research introduces the single truck multi-drone routing and scheduling problem with en route operations for last-mile parcel delivery. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to minimize the delivery completion time. In addition, a variant is introduced to minimize the total delivery cost. Since the problem under consideration is NP-hard, a relax-and-fix with re-couple-refine-and-optimize (RF-RRO) heuristic approach is proposed, where the associated decisions (truck routing and drone scheduling) are decomposed into two stages and solved sequentially. Besides, a deep learning-based clustering procedure is developed to establish an initial solution and accelerate the convergence speed of the RF-RRO heuristic. Notably, the proposed approach is extended to solve a multi-truck multi-drone variant using a deep learning-based cluster-first route-second heuristic. Our numerical results show that the proposed MILP model is able to solve problem instances with up to 20 customers optimally in a reasonable time. The proposed RF-RRO heuristic can achieve optimal (or near-optimal) solutions for small instances and is computationally efficient for large cases. Extensive experimental analysis shows 30% average savings in delivery completion time, and an average drone utilization of 62% if en route drone operations are considered. In addition, numerical results provide insights on the impact of heterogeneous drone fleet and customer density. ", "label": "True"}

Remote sensing of maize nitrogen deficiency may be one way to move nitrogen fertilizer applications closer to the specific nitrogen requirement. Six vegetation indices [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI), triangle greenness index (TGI), normalized area vegetation index (NAVI) and chlorophyll index-green (CIgreen)] were evaluated for their ability to detect nitrogen deficiency and predict grain maize grain yield. Strip trials were established at two locations in Arkansas, USA, with nitrogen rate as the primary treatment. Remote sensing data was collected weekly with an unmanned aerial system (UAS) equipped with a multispectral and thermal sensor. Relationships among index value, nitrogen fertilizer rate and maize growth stage were evaluated. Green NDVI, RENDVI and CIgreen had the strongest relationship with nitrogen fertilizer treatment. Chlorophyll Index-green and GNDVI were the best predictors of maize grain yield early in the growing season when the application of additional nitrogen was still agronomically feasible. However, the logistics of late season nitrogen application must be considered. ", "label": "False"}

In this study, a collaborative truck-and-drone system was developed as a post-disaster assessment tool for use by humanitarian relief networks. The proposed system comprises a drone equipped with a camera that can launch from a truck to collect information from both nodes and links of a post-disaster transportation network. Following drone operation, the truck is used to retrieve and recharge the drone's battery. To optimize this collaborative truck-and-drone system, we focused on the routing problem with the objective of maximizing the value of information collected from nodes and links within a predefined time limit, a problem made challenging by the need to determine the routes of the truck and drone in an integrated manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to consider the problem of collaborative truck-and-drone routing optimization with the goal of profit maximization. After formulating the proposed problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, we decomposed the problem structure into a path-based master problem and two sub-problems to allow the use of a column generation (CG) framework to tackle the problem. Numerical experiments were conducted to examine the proposed model and algorithm at various instance sizes that were generated by modifying an existing benchmark, with the results indicating that the proposed algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions with optimality gaps of less than 10% for all terminated instances within predefined time limit.

{"text": "Title: An edge-based stochastic facility location problem in UAV-supported humanitarian relief logistics: a case study of Tehran earthquake Abstract: The application of facility location problems in choosing the best location of relief distribution centers plays a salient role in emergency operations of large-scale disasters. On the premise that the service recipients are uniformly distributed along the network edges, this study investigates a combined mobile and immobile pre-earthquake facility location problem. A predefined number of locations are to be selected among a set of potential locations. Each facility is used in the relief distribution operation. It is incontrovertible that due to earthquakes, some network edges collapse and corresponding areas may lose their accessibility. Thus in this study, it is assumed that people on intact and accessible edges travel to the location of the distribution centers to receive the relief. For those who are located on collapsed or inaccessible network edges, the medium-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopters are utilized in the relief distribution operation. This study aims to develop a mathematical model which minimizes the aggregate traveling time for both people and UAVs over a set of feasible scenarios.

{"text": "Title: Enhanced Detection of Small Unmanned Aerial System Using Noise Suppression Super-Resolution Detector for Effective Airspace Surveillance Abstract: Small unmanned aerial systems have become increasingly prevalent in various fields, including agriculture, logistics and the public sector, but concerns over misuse, such as military intrusions and terrorist attacks, highlight the necessity for effective aerial surveillance. Although conventional radar systems can detect large areas, they face challenges in accurately identifying small drones. In contrast, vision sensors offer high-resolution identification but encounter challenges in long-range detection and real-time processing. To address these limitations, this study proposes a vision sensor-based detection framework, termed the noise suppression super-resolution detector (NSSRD). To ensure the reliability and real-time capability of small drone detection, NSSRD integrates image segmentation, noise suppression, super-resolution transformation, and efficient detection processes. NSSRD divides the surveillance area into uniform sections, applies a bilateral filter to suppress noise before passing the images to an object detection model, and uses a region of interest selection process to reduce the detection area and computational load. The experimental results demonstrate that NSSRD outperforms existing models, achieving a 24% improvement in the true positive rate and a 25% increase in recall at an altitude of 40 m, validating its superior performance.

{"text": "Title: The multi-purpose K-drones general routing problem Abstract: In this article, we present and solve the multi-pur pose K-drones general routing problem (MP K-DGRP). In this optimization problem, a fleet of multi-pur pose drones, aerial vehicles that can both make deliveries and conduct sensing activities (e.g., imaging), have to jointly visit a set of nodes to make deliveries and map one or more continuous areas. This problem is motivated by global healthcare applica-tions that deploy multipurpose drones that combine delivery trips with collection of aerial imaging data for use in emergency preparedness and resilience planning. The continuous areas that have to be mapped may correspond to terrain surfaces (e.g., flooded areas or regions with a disease outbreak) or to infrastructure networks to be inspected. The continuous areas can be modeled as a set of lines so that each area is completely serviced if all the lines covering it are traversed. Thus, given a set of nodes and a set of lines, the problem is to design drone routes of shortest total duration traversing the lines and visiting the nodes, while not exceeding the range limit (flight time) and capacity (loading) of the drones. Unlike ground vehicles in classical routing problems, drones can enter a line through any of its points, service only a part of that line and then exit through another of its points. The possibility of flying directly between any two points of the network offered by drones can lead to reduced costs, but it increases the difficulty of the problem. To deal with this problem, the lines are discretized, allowing drones to enter and exit each line only at a finite set of points, thus obtaining an instance of the K-vehicles general routing problem (K-GRP). We present in this article an integer programming formulation for the K-GRP and propose a matheuristic algorithm and a branch-and-cut proce-dure for its solution. Results are provided for problems with up to 20 deliveries and up to 28 continuous areas. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Solving the vehicle routing problem with drone for delivery services using an ant colony optimization algorithm Abstract: E-commerce and logistics companies are facing important challenges to satisfy the rapid growth of customer demands. Unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones are an emerging technology that are very useful to cope with rising customer expectations of fast, flexible, and reliable delivery services. Drones work in tandem with trucks to perform parcel delivery, which have proven to reduce costs, CO2 emissions, and delivery times. This research proposes a mixed integer programming formulation to address the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drone (VRPD) by assigning customers to drone-truck pairs, determining the number of dispatching drone-truck units, and obtaining optimal service routes while the fixed and travel costs of both vehicles are minimized. Given the NP-hard nature of the VRPD, an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is elaborated to solve this problem. Two novel methods are proposed to investigate the efficiency of the drone-truck combination by allowing the drones to perform additional delivery services to only one feasible customer and also multiple feasible customers while the truck waits at a customer location. Experimental results show that the proposed ACO algorithm can effec-tively solve the VRDP for different size instances and different customer location distributions, and is successful in providing timely solutions for small test instances within 1% of the optimal solutions. Finally, experimentation also reveals that the ACO algorithm outperforms the classical VRP by obtaining cost-savings of over 30% for large instances. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: A Real-Time Path Planning Method for Urban Low-Altitude Logistics UAVs Abstract: To solve the problem of poor real-time performance in path planning algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in low-altitude urban logistics, a path planning method combining modified Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) with the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, based on the requirements of task execution and constraints of UAV flight, a fitness function for real-time search of waypoints is designed while ensuring the safety and obstacle avoidance of the UAV. Then, to improve the search accuracy and real-time performance, determining the initial search direction in the BAS algorithm is improved, while the search step size and antennae sensing length are updated in real-time according to the distance between the UAV and the obstacle. Finally, the SA algorithm is combined with the BAS algorithm to update the waypoints, expanding the search range of each waypoint, avoiding the process of updating the waypoints from becoming trapped in the local optimal waypoints. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the next waypoint is evaluated based on the Metropolis criterion. This paper generates a virtual urban logistics distribution environment based on the density and distribution of urban buildings, and compares the performance of algorithms in obstacle-sparse, obstacle-moderate, and obstacle-dense environments. The simulation results demonstrate that the improved method in this paper has a more significant capacity for environmental adaptation.

{"text": "Title: Morphodynamic evolution of paraglacial spit complexes on a tide-influenced Arctic fjord delta (Dicksonfjorden, Svalbard) Abstract: Recent global warming triggered pronounced geomorphic changes such as coastal retreat and delta progradation along the coastlines of the Arctic regions. Coastal morphodynamics and associated sediment transport at the Arctic fjord head remain relatively unexplored due to the logistically limited accessibility to the field area, especially at short-term temporal scales. A repeat survey using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted photogrammetry was conducted to quantify the annual morphodynamics of gravel spit complexes developed on the tidal delta plain of the deglaciated Dicksonfjorden, Svalbard of Arctic. Results show that the spit morphodynamics varies in time and space with an overall downfjord increase in the growth and migration rate of the spits. The youngest spits elongated 22 m yr(-1) and migrated landward 4.3 m yr(-1) between 2015 and 2019, marking the most pronounced spit morphodynamics documented to date in the Svalbard fjord systems. The spit morphodynamics is driven primarily by longshore drift and to a lesser degree by overwash processes. Gravels constituting the spits originate from the unconsolidated debris-flow deposits of old alluvial fans, which locally retreat 0.5 m yr? 1. The growth of the spit complexes is also fed by snow meltwater discharge on the alluvial fans, accounting for a downfjord imbrication of angular gravel layers that are intercalated with interlaminated sands and muds on the landward sides of the spits. The breached spits at the most upfjord location have remained stationary during the study period and presumably since the 1930s. Rapid delta progradation combined with an isostatic rebound after the Little Ice Age (LIA) has decreased spit morphodynamics on the tidal delta plain upfjord in Dicksonfjorden with infrequent and insignificant wave influence. Sparse distribution of the isolated spits signifies the intermittent spit development, which is constrained by the proximity to the protruded alluvial fans. The spit complexes in Dicksonfjorden highlight that climate change accelerates coastal geomorphic changes at the fjord head by enhancing wave intensity and regulating episodic sediment delivery that led to the downfjord shift in the locus of wave shoaling.

{"text": "Title: Remote sensing techniques for automated marine mammals detection: a review of methods and current challenges Abstract: Marine mammals are under pressure from multiple threats, such as global climate change, bycatch, and vessel collisions. In this context, more frequent and spatially extensive surveys for abundance and distribution studies are necessary to inform conservation efforts. Marine mammal surveys have been performed visually from land, ships, and aircraft. These methods can be costly, logistically challenging in remote locations, dangerous to researchers, and disturbing to the animals. The growing use of imagery from satellite and unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) can help address some of these challenges, complementing crewed surveys and allowing for more frequent and evenly distributed surveys, especially for remote locations. However, manual counts in satellite and UAS imagery remain time and labor intensive, but the automation of image analyses offers promising solutions. Here, we reviewed the literature for automated methods applied to detect marine mammals in satellite and UAS imagery. The performance of studies is quantitatively compared with metrics that evaluate false positives and false negatives from automated detection against manual counts of animals, which allows for a better assessment of the impact of miscounts in conservation contexts. In general, methods that relied solely on statistical differences in the spectral responses of animals and their surroundings performed worse than studies that used convolutional neural networks (CNN). Despite mixed results, CNN showed promise, and its use and evaluation should continue. Overall, while automation can reduce time and labor, more research is needed to improve the accuracy of automated counts. With the current state of knowledge, it is best to use semi-automated approaches that involve user revision of the output. These approaches currently enable the best tradeoff between time effort and detection accuracy. Based on our analysis, we identified thermal infrared UAS imagery as a future research avenue for marine mammal detection and also recommend the further exploration of object-based image analysis (OBIA). Our analysis also showed that past studies have focused on the automated detection of baleen whales and pinnipeds and that there is a gap in studies looking at toothed whales, polar bears, sirenians, and mustelids.

Regardless of economic challenges, the last-mile delivery faces social and environmental barriers to continuing operations while complying with environmental and social standards, therefore incorporating sustainability into last-mile logistic strategy is no longer an option but rather a necessity. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to consider a last-mile delivery in a blood supply chain in terms of using appropriate technologies such as drones to assess sustainability. Design/methodology/approach The authors discuss the impact of drone technology on last-mile delivery and its importance in achieving sustainability. They focus on the effect of using drones on CO2 emission, costs and social benefits by proposing a multi-objective mathematical model to assess sustainability in the last-mile delivery.

Current SDRs perform well in battery-equipped systems, but fail to support miniaturized IoT devices with stringent hardware and power constraints. This paper takes the first step toward designing an ultra-low-power SDR that satisfies the ultra-low-power or even battery-free requirements of intelligent and simplified IoT networks. To achieve this goal, the core technique is the effective integration of mu W-level backscatter in our SDR to sidestep power-hungry active radio frequency chains. We carefully develop a novel circuit design for efficient energy harvesting and power control, and devise a competent solution for eliminating the harmonic and mirror frequencies caused by backscatter hardware. We evaluate the proposed SDR using different modulation schemes, and it achieves a high data rate of 100 kb/s with power consumption less than 200 mu W in the active mode and as low as 10 mu W in the sleep mode.

West African crocodylian populations are declining and in need of conservation action. Surveys and other monitoring methods are critical components of crocodile conservation programs; however, surveys are often hindered by logistical, financial and detectability constraints. Increasingly used in wildlife monitoring programs, drones can enhance monitoring and conservation efficacy. Aims. This study aimed to determine a standard drone crocodylian survey protocol and evaluate the drones as a tool to survey the diverse crocodylian assemblage of West Africa. Methods. We surveyed crocodile populations in Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Niger in 2017 and 2018, by using the DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone and via traditional diurnal and nocturnal spotlight surveys. We used a series of test flights to first evaluate the impact of drones on crocodylian behaviour and determine standard flight parameters that optimise detectability. We then, consecutively, implemented the three survey methods at 23 sites to compare the efficacy of drones against traditional crocodylian survey methods. Key results. Crocodylus suchus can be closely approached (>10 m altitude) and consumer-grade drones do not elicit flight responses in West African large mammals and birds at altitudes of >40-60 m. Altitude and other flight parameters did not affect detectability, because high-resolution photos allowed accurate counting. Observer experience, field conditions (e.g. wind, sun reflection), and site characteristics (e.g. vegetation, homogeneity) all significantly affected detectability. Drone-based crocodylian surveys should be implemented from 40 m altitude in the first third of the day. Comparing survey methods, drones performed better than did traditional diurnal surveys but worse than standard nocturnal spotlight counts. The latter not only detected more individuals, but also a greater size-class diversity. However, drone surveys provide advantages over traditional methods, including precise size estimation, less disturbance, and the ability to cover greater and more remote areas. Drone survey photos allow for repeatable and quantifiable habitat assessments, detection of encroachment and other illegal activities, and leave a permanent record. Conclusions. Overall, drones offer a valuable and cost-effective alternative for surveying crocodylian populations with compelling secondary benefits, although they may not be suitable in all cases and for all species.

{"text": "Title: Towards the sustainable economy through digital technology: A drone-aided after-sales service scheduling model Abstract: Many companies are implementing emerging digital technologies to improve service quality. The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., drones) in electronic products after-sales service operations is a prominent example. With drones, the products that need after-sales services (e.g., repairment) can be delivered between the company store and consumers without requiring consumers to visit the store, which not only enhances consumer satisfaction but also helps improve environmental sustainability as fewer electronic products will be abandoned with the higher after-sales service levels. However, how to optimize drone-aided after-sales operations is still under-explored. An efficient decision support system may leverage the performance of the new service model. This work thus develops a new drone-aided after-sales service optimization model and proposes efficient solution algorithms. In particular, the company provides quick pick-up, repair, and delivery services through online reservation platforms. The store uses drones to perform pick-up and delivery services, and a set of technicians is available to perform the repair tasks. Given a set of service requests, the store must schedule limited resources, i.e., technicians and drones, to maximize the total profit of a workday. We formally describe the scheduling problem under this new model and formulate it as a mixed-integer linear programming model. We then show how the problem can be piece-wisely transformed into a variant of the flexible job shop scheduling problem. We propose several new formulations based on this idea. To handle practical-sized instances, we develop a new fix-and-solve matheuristic that consists of a sorting rule determination process and an approximate model solving process. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models and matheuristic. Sensitivity analyses are also performed to provide useful and practical implications for decision-makers. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Integrating high resolution drone imagery and forest inventory to distinguish canopy and understory trees and quantify their contributions to forest structure and dynamics Abstract: Tree growth and survival differ strongly between canopy trees (those directly exposed to overhead light), and understory trees. However, the structural complexity of many tropical forests makes it difficult to determine canopy positions. The integration of remote sensing and ground-based data enables this determination and measurements of how canopy and understory trees differ in structure and dynamics. Here we analyzed 2 cm resolution RGB imagery collected by a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), also known as drone, together with two decades of bi-annual tree censuses for 2 ha of old growth forest in the Central Amazon. We delineated all crowns visible in the imagery and linked each crown to a tagged stem through field work. Canopy trees constituted 40% of the 1244 inventoried trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 10 cm, and accounted for similar to 70% of aboveground carbon stocks and wood productivity. The probability of being in the canopy increased logistically with tree diameter, passing through 50% at 23.5 cm DBH. Diameter growth was on average twice as large in canopy trees as in understory trees. Growth rates were unrelated to diameter in canopy trees and positively related to diameter in understory trees, consistent with the idea that light availability increases with diameter in the understory but not the canopy. The whole stand size distribution was best fit by a Weibull distribution, whereas the separate size distributions of understory trees or canopy trees > 25 cm DBH were equally well fit by exponential and Weibull distributions, consistent with mechanistic forest models. The identification and field mapping of crowns seen in a high resolution orthomosaic revealed new patterns in the structure and dynamics of trees of canopy vs. understory at this site, demonstrating the value of traditional tree censuses with drone remote sensing.

However, many challenges are still to be addressed with PAM: difficulty in accessing research sites, the logistics of implementing large-scale studies and the invasiveness of data collection. When combined with PAM and other sensing strategies, mobile robotics are a promising solution to directly address these challenges. In this paper, we integrate water surface and underwater acoustic monitoring equipment onto a prototype unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicle (UAAV) capable of sailing and flight (SailMAV). Twelve autonomous sailing missions were run on Lake Vrana, Croatia, during which acoustic data were collected, and the ability of the UAAV to facilitate the collection of acoustic data demonstrated. Data were simultaneously collected using standard recording methods on buoys and banksides to provide a comparative approach. Acoustic indices were used to analyse the soundscape of underwater acoustic data and BirdNET (a deep artificial neural network) was used on water surface datasets to determine bird species composition. Results show higher species richness and call abundance from UAAV surveys and high site dissimilarity owing to turnover between stationary and UAAV methods. This highlights the success of the UAAV in detecting biodiversity and the complementarity of these methods in providing a broad picture of the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems. Increased bird diversity and underwater acoustic activity in protected areas demonstrate the benefits of protecting freshwater ecosystems; however, site dissimilarity driven by turnover highlights the importance of protecting the entire ecosystem.

Recently, collaborative distribution using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground vehicles has been considered as a means of reducing costs and enhancing efficiency, thus overcoming the issues created by the high-density layout of enterprises' relatively independent networks. This essentially involves constructing an air-ground collaborative common distribution network. To optimize the economic cost and distribution time of network operations, we established a site selection planning model for air-ground cooperative urban co-distribution centers and designed a solution method based on gray wolf optimization with K-means clustering. Taking the Wangsheren area of Jinan City, China, as an example, 15 UAV co-distribution centers and 13 vehicle co-distribution centers were identified. Although the average distribution cost of the network rose by 35-50% compared to traditional terminal distribution, the time saving was 80-85%, greatly improving the high-value-added service capacity. The end-distribution efficiency and customer satisfaction were also enhanced, which fully verifies the feasibility, validity, and applicability of the proposed model.

In this context, the salesman represents the driver of a home delivery truck. Given a set of customers to be visited, the truck has a limited capacity, so that only a subset of shipments can be loaded on board when leaving the depot. The remainder of the shipments has to be resupplied to the truck on its tour by a single unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). In order to do so, the drone picks up shipments (one by one) at the depot and delivers them toward the truck. Our extension of the TSP aims at a tour of the truck through the set of given customers and a resupply schedule for the drone, so that the total delivery costs are minimized. We develop suited optimization approaches and apply them in static and dynamic problem settings. We, furthermore, benchmark the savings enabled by drone resupply with alternative home delivery options with and without drone support.

The controllability of drone aircraft and quality cameras, even in less expensive aerial models, offers opportunities for students to learn and collect their own imagery for a variety of applications. This opportunity can be taught with an active learning approach. The challenge for instructors is to cover the three fundamentals in the remote sensing workflow - planning, collection, and image processing - while minimizing logistical issues associated with actual flight operation. The logistical issues (e.g. policy, legal, safety, weather) for an outdoor aerial drone learning experience are quite daunting, particularly for urban campuses with local/state restrictions on the use of drone aircraft. In this article, we separate the fundamental learning concepts in the remote sensing workflow from the flight operation and provide a learning environment for unlimited experiments.

To ensure the stable and reliable operation of UASs, fault diagnosis is essential, which can enhance safety, and minimize potential risks and losses. However, most existing fault diagnosis methods rely on a single physical quantity as the primary information source or solely consider fault data at a single moment, leading to challenges of low diagnostic accuracy and limited reliability. Aimed at this problem, this paper presents a fault diagnosis method based on time-space domain weighted information fusion for UASs. First, the Gaussian fault model is constructed for the data with different fault features in the space domain. Next, the weighted coefficient method is used to generate the basic probability assignment (BPA) by matching the fault data with the Gaussian fault model. Then, the Dempster's combination rule, which enables the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, is adopted to fuse the generated BPAs. Based on this, the pignistic probability transformation is performed to determine the fault type.

Drone deliveries have a two-pronged advantage as they have the potential to lessen delivery time by avoiding traffic congestions, and the inherent structure that reduces its carbon footprint compared to traditional modes of transportation under some restrictions. To leverage this potential, many companies across the world have developed and tested drones for real-world applications. However, many factors may play a significant role in the adoption of drone-delivery in the logistics sector. This paper attempts to unearth such critical success factors and establish the interrelationships between these factors. Twelve critical success factors were identified by systematically reviewing the literature and taking inputs from experts. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making technique, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)', combined with the Grey-based approach, was used to envisage causal relationships between the identified critical success factors.

In the industrial areas of smart city, the IoT focuses on industrial applications, such as logistics and environmental monitoring. In this work, an auxiliary position analysis framework composed of IoT and distributed mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed to analyze the position of vehicles in the industrial areas of smart city. In the proposed framework, IoT are deployed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with uniform linear array (ULA), which receives the signal emitted by vehicles for obtaining the direction of arrival (DOA), and the distributed MEC provides computing and synchronization services to auxiliary positioning. The DOA estimation is a key issue for auxiliary positioning in the proposed framework. To realize DOA estimation with unknown mutual coupling (MC) existing in IoT nodes, a novel block sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is developed. In the developed algorithm, the unknown MC existing between sensors in each IoT nodes is first fused with the signal by parameterizing steering vector. Then, a block SBL (BSBL) procedure is presented to perform DOA estimation by using the inherent block sparse structure in the equivalent signal obtained after fusion. Benefiting from the fusion of MC and signal, the developed DOA estimation algorithm does not require a separate estimation of the unknown MC and also does not cause the loss of the array aperture. Based on the DOA estimation information, the position of vehicles in the industrial environment is effectively analyzed through weighted multiple cross-locations. Synthetic data set simulation is carried out to verify that the vehicle positions in smart city can be efficiently analyzed and estimated based on the presented framework and algorithm.

{"text": "Title: Considering both energy effectiveness and flight safety in UAV trajectory planning for intelligent logistics Abstract: In low-altitude economic logistics scenarios, trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be treated as a typical traveling salesman problem (TSP). High-rise buildings in urban areas not only severely impact the flight safety of UAVs, but also increase their energy consumption when avoiding obstacles, thereby affecting their delivery ranges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage trajectory planning solution called ACO-DQN-TP for logistics UAVs. In the first stage, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is applied to solve the sequence for multi-target point deliveries, to obtain the optimal flight paths. The ant tabu table is reopened to allow for retracing of the movement paths in order to avoid forward search dilemmas. In the second stage, a deep Q-network (DQN) is combined with the traditional artificial potential field method to enhance the interaction between UAVs and their environment. The rewards are accumulated using two potential functions generated based on the target points and obstacles, to minimize the changes in the yaw angles and smooth the flight trajectory of the UAV. Simulation experiments were conducted on UAV trajectory planning for delivery missions with four to ten target points. The simulation results show that the average path length obtained by ACO-DQN-TP is 65% and 79% shorter than that of Greedy +DQNPF and BACO, respectively, and the sum of turning angles along the path is 56% of Greedy DQNPF and 72% of BACO on average. It indicates that the proposed ACO-DQN-TP scheme not only optimizes delivery routes compared to traditional ACOs but also effectively controls the magnitude of the changes in heading angle during flight. This ensures flight safety for the UAV through obstacle avoidance while reducing flight energy consumption. In particular, the heading angle optimization mechanism proposed in this paper has universal guiding significance for low-altitude flights in the areas of traffic and transportation using UAVs.

{"text": "Title: A comparison of drone imagery and ground-based methods for estimating the extent of habitat destruction by lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) in La Perouse Bay Abstract: Lesser snow goose (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) populations have dramatically altered vegetation communities through increased foraging pressure. In remote regions, regular habitat assessments are logistically challenging and time consuming. Drones are increasingly being used by ecologists to conduct habitat assessments, but reliance on georeferenced data as ground truth may not always be feasible. We estimated goose habitat degradation using photointerpretation of drone imagery and compared estimates to those made with ground-based linear transects. In July 2016, we surveyed five study plots in La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, to evaluate the effectiveness of a fixed-wing drone with simple Red Green Blue (RGB) imagery for evaluating habitat degradation by snow geese. Ground-based land cover data was collected and grouped into barren, shrub, or non-shrub categories. We compared estimates between ground-based transects and those made from unsupervised classification of drone imagery collected at altitudes of 75, 100, and 120 m above ground level (ground sampling distances of 2.4, 3.2, and 3.8 cm respectively). We found large time savings during the data collection step of drone surveys, but these savings were ultimately lost during imagery processing. Based on photointerpretation, overall accuracy of drone imagery was generally high (88.8% to 92.0%) and Kappa coefficients were similar to previously published habitat assessments from drone imagery. Mixed model estimates indicated 75m drone imagery overestimated barren (F-2,F-182 = 100.03, P < 0.0001) and shrub classes (F-2,F-182 = 160.16, P < 0.0001) compared to ground estimates.

{"text": "Title: Air Route Network Planning Method of Urban Low-Altitude Logistics UAV with Double-Layer Structure Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, logistics UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have shown great potential in the field of urban logistics. However, the large-scale operation of logistics UAVs has brought challenges to air traffic management, and the competitiveness of UAV logistics is still weak compared with traditional ground logistics. Therefore, this paper constructs a double-layer route network structure that separates logistics transshipment from terminal delivery. In the delivery layer, a door-to-door distribution mode is adopted, and the transshipment node service location model is constructed, so as to obtain the location of the transshipment node and the service relationship. In the transshipment layer, the index of the route betweenness standard deviation (BSD) is introduced to construct the route network planning model. In order to solve the above model, a double-layer algorithm was designed. In the upper layer, the multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm (MOSA) is used to solve the transshipment node service location issue, and in the lower layer, the multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is adopted to solve the network planning model. Based on real obstacle data and the demand situation, the double-layer network was constructed through simulation experiments. To verify the network rationality, actual flights were carried out on some routes, and it was found that the gap between the UAV's autonomous flight route time and the theoretical calculations was relatively small. The simulation results show that compared with the single-layer network, the total distance with the double-layer network was reduced by 62.5% and the structural intersection was reduced by 96.9%. Compared with the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm, the total task flight distance obtained with the NSGA-II was reduced by 42.4%. The BSD factors can mitigate potential congestion risks. The route network proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the number of intersections and make the UAV passing volume more balanced. ", "label": "True"}

Successful efforts to breed higher-yielding maize varieties depend on replicated yield trials in many environments. Capturing in-season data can help improve and accelerate the development of regionally adapted hybrids, but collecting these data can be impractical in many locations. We demonstrate that satellite remote sensing could play a similar role in crop performance assessment as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but with far lower labor costs and the greatest ease of collection at remote field sites. This dataset and benchmarks have the potential to enable predictive models that could guide farmers and crop breeders in decision-making.Summary Accurate early yield estimates at fields and plots offer potential benefits to farmers in optimizing their agronomic practices and breeders in screening thousands of varieties contributing to improving agriculture and food production systems. Effective approaches to track plant growth and predict yield require large datasets of remote sensing and ground truth data collected across multiple environments. Low-altitude drone flights are increasingly being used to collect data from field evaluations of new crop varieties, while satellite imagery is being explored to track yield and management practices at regional scales. Satellite platforms exhibit logistical and technical advantages in scalability and accessibility and could facilitate plot-level predictions, especially with steadily improving spatial resolution. However, plot-level, high-resolution satellite images capturing differences in genotypes from multiple environments with ground truth measurements are not publicly available.

{"text": "Title: Insight into the kinematics of blue whale surface foraging through drone observations and prey data Abstract: To understand how predators optimize foraging strategies, extensive knowledge of predator behavior and prey distribution is needed. Blue whales employ an energetically demanding lunge feeding method that requires the whales to selectively feed where energetic gain exceeds energetic loss, while also balancing oxygen consumption, breath holding capacity, and surface recuperation time. Hence, blue whale foraging behavior is primarily driven by krill patch density and depth, but many studies have not fully considered surface feeding as a significant foraging strategy in energetic models. We collected predator and prey data on a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) foraging ground in New Zealand in February 2017 to assess the distributional and behavioral response of blue whales to the distribution and density of krill prey aggregations. Krill density across the study region was greater toward the surface (upper 20 m), and blue whales were encountered where prey was relatively shallow and more dense. This relationship was particularly evident where foraging and surface lunge feeding were observed. Furthermore, New Zealand blue whales also had relatively short dive times (2.83 +/- 0.27 SE min) as compared to other blue whale populations, which became even shorter at foraging sightings and where surface lunge feeding was observed. Using an unmanned aerial system (UAS; drone) we also captured unique video of a New Zealand blue whale's surface feeding behavior on well-illuminated krill patches. Video analysis illustrates the whale's potential use of vision to target prey, make foraging decisions, and orient body mechanics relative to prey patch characteristics. Kinematic analysis of a surface lunge feeding event revealed biomechanical coordination through speed, acceleration, head inclination, roll, and distance from krill patch to maximize prey engulfment. We compared these lunge kinematics to data previously reported from tagged blue whale lunges at depth to demonstrate strong similarities, and provide rare measurements of gape size, and krill response distance and time. These findings elucidate the predator-prey relationship between blue whales and krill, and provide support for the hypothesis that surface feeding by New Zealand blue whales is an important component to their foraging ecology used to optimize their energetic efficiency. Understanding how blue whales make foraging decisions presents logistical challenges, which may cause incomplete sampling and biased ecological knowledge if portions of their foraging behavior are undocumented. We conclude that surface foraging could be an important strategy for blue whales, and integration of UAS with tag-based studies may expand our understanding of their foraging ecology by examining surface feeding events in conjunction with behaviors at depth.

We also mapped a detailed canopy fragmen-tation and developed digital surface models (DSM) during five study periods (2018-2021) with a consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over an area of 100 ha. Based on optical data from the GEE time series, results indicated an abrupt decline in the overall mangrove canopy. The VARI index was the most reliable VI for the mangrove canopy classification from a standard RGB sensor. The impact of the hurricane caused an overall canopy defoliation of 79%. The series of UAV orthomosaics indicate a gradual recovery in the mangrove canopy, while the linear model predicts at least 8.5 years to reach pre-impact mangrove cover conditions. However, the sequence of DSM estimates that the vertical canopy configuration will require a longer time to achieve its original structure. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: The Use of UAVs in Humanitarian Relief: An Application of POMDP-Based Methodology for Finding Victims Abstract: Researchers have proposed the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in humanitarian relief to search for victims in disaster-affected areas. Once UAVs must search through the entire affected area to find victims, the path-planning operation becomes equivalent to an area coverage problem. In this study, we propose an innovative method for solving such problem based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which considers the observations made from UAVs. The formulation of the UAV path planning is based on the idea of assigning higher priorities to the areas that are more likely to have victims. We applied the method to three illustrative cases, considering different types of disasters: a tornado in Brazil, a refugee camp in South Sudan, and a nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan. The results demonstrated that the POMDP solution achieves full coverage of disaster-affected areas within a reasonable time span. We evaluate the traveled distance and the operation duration (which were quite stable), as well as the time required to find groups of victims by a detailed multivariate sensitivity analysis. The comparisons with a Greedy Algorithm showed that the POMDP finds victims more quickly, which is the priority in humanitarian relief, whereas the performance of the Greedy focuses on minimizing the traveled distance. We also discuss the ethical, legal, and social acceptance issues that can influence the application of the proposed methodology in practice. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: A GRASP/VND algorithm for the energy minimizing drone routing problem with pickups and deliveries Abstract: In recent years, the growth of online markets in social media and auction websites, has resulted in a significant increase in direct trading between people. Unlike traditional commerce, which relies on a multi-layered supply chain, person-to-person transactions depend on courier companies for delivering the items, thus, it can be considered a third-party logistics scheme. The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, is ideal for this type of commerce, as most of the traded items are small-sized and light-weight. Logistic companies are already experimenting with using drones in their delivery operations, as their benefits are both financial and environmental. This paper, introduces the Energy Minimizing Drone Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries (EM-DRP-PD), to address scenarios of direct trading between individuals, where the logistics company provides the courier service using drones. The EM-DRP-PD focuses on minimizing the total energy consumption of operations and accounts for the range constraints imposed by the drones, which is influenced by the weight of the packages carried. The formulation of the EM-DRP-PD is presented. Three variants of a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure metaheuristic algorithm are implemented for solving the EM-DRP-PD. The algorithms are compared based on generated EM-DRP-PD benchmark instances ranging from 50 to 200 customers. The study compares both, energy and distance, objective approaches and discusses the results. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: Fuzzy synthetic evaluation of the critical drivers of UAVs' deployment for construction in Nigeria Abstract: Purpose- The slow adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the construction industry, particularly in developing countries like Nigeria, underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the critical factors influencing their adoption. This study aims to identify these factors using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and address uncertainties in their prioritization through Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE). The utility of this approach lies in its ability to provide construction organizations with actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness through effective UAV adoption. Design/methodology/approach- A post-positivist philosophical stance was adopted, wherein quantitative data were gathered from construction professionals in Nigeria via a questionnaire survey. The collected data were analyzed using the Cronbach alpha test as a measure of internal consistency and the FSE test to synthesize critical drivers for the adoption of UAVs. Findings- The study found that drivers related to technology and organization are the most critical drivers. This implies that variables related to technology and organization warrant a higher level of focus if UAVs are to continue gaining popularity within the construction industry. Additionally, this study identified that logistic management, construction monitoring and site surveying represent the most critical areas of UAV application within the construction industry. Practical implications- The emphasis on technology and organizational drivers as critical factors suggests that construction companies should prioritize investments in technology infrastructure and cultivate an organizational culture that embraces innovation. This may involve providing training to construction professionals to enhance their technological skills and fostering a leadership culture that champions technology adoption. Originality/value- This study introduces novelty by applying the TOE framework, which has received limited attention in UAV adoption studies within construction. Additionally, the use of FSE addresses uncertainties in prioritizing critical drivers, particularly relevant in developing countries facing unique technological challenges. By assigning priority to these factors, this research lays the groundwork for a more informed and strategic approach to UAV adoption. ", "label": "True"}

An example is represented by the logistics sector, where UAVs have been proven to be able to improve the efficiency of the process itself, as their cooperation with trucks can decrease the delivery time and reduce fuel consumption. In this paper, we first state a mathematical formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) applied to logistic routing, where a truck cooperates synchronously with multiple UAVs for parcel delivery. Then, we propose, implement, and compare different sub-optimal routing approaches to the formulated mFSTSP (multiple Flying Sidekick Travelling Salesman Problem) since the inherent combinatorial computational complexity of the problem makes it unattractable for commercial Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers. A local search algorithm, two hybrid genetic algorithms that permutate feasible and infeasible solutions, and an alternative ad-hoc greedy method are evaluated in terms of the total delivery time of the output schedule. For the sake of the evaluation, the savings in terms of delivery time over the well-documented truck-only TSP solution are investigated for each proposed routing solution, and this is repeated for two different scenarios. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the results. ", "label": "True"}

Using remote sensing techniques to monitor macroalgae is a promising way of optimizing efforts in relation to logistics and personnel. This study aimed to quantify the cover and biomass of the predominant macroalgae in a rocky intertidal zone (of area 5.9 ha) in NW Spain. Drone monitoring with multispectral sensors, in situ photography and biomass sampling were conducted in June and July, 2021 (i.e. in summer, when macroalgae are most abundant in the study area). The macroalgae were classified using Minimum Distance, Spectral Angle Mapping and Maximum Likelihood algorithms, the latter of which proved the most accurate. The fresh weight of macroalgae determined in the quadrat sampling was regressed on the cover of July to enable subsequent estimation of biomass from the classification maps. The area occupied by brown algae (phylum Ochrophyta) in July 2021 was estimated to be 5574 m2 with a biomass of 28.5 t. The remote sensing method, which did not require in-depth knowledge of programming, proved to be a rapid, effective means of estimating macroalgal cover.

This paper shows the assessment of tSHA variability over two production units (PUs), considering radiometric response (optical camera), physicochemical (texture, pH, electrical conductivity), and statistical and geostatistical data analysis. By using unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and laboratory analysis, our results revealed that the integration between UAS-RGB and physicochemical data can improve the estimation accuracy of tSHA distribution. Firstly, the UAS-RGB dataset was used to isolate bare soil from the vegetative radiometric contribution.

{"text": "Title: Collaborative truck-and-drone delivery for inventory-routing problems Abstract: With the retail market more competitive than it has ever been and with profit margins razor -thin, it has become of the essence that business operations are conducted as cost-efficiently as possible. With traditional methods exhausted, companies now see it worthwhile to explore fundamentally paradigm-shifting methods to create savings. For the logistics industry, one such approach is the incorporation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, into the delivery cycle, whose per-mile transportation costs are much lower than those of trucks, the traditional mode of transportation for deliveries. Yet despite the long-standing promise of drones to revolutionize the supply chain, realistic proposals for the exact ways in which UAVs would be introduced into delivery operations have only recently begun to appear in the operations research literature. Particularly noteworthy among these proposals is the concept of collaborative truck-and-drone operation, which captures the advantages of each of the two modes of delivery involved while attenuating their respective downsides. Over the past five years, collaborative delivery has been studied extensively in the classical contexts of the traveling salesman problem and the vehicle-routing problem. In this paper, we offer a first incursion into studying the incorporation of tandem truck-drone delivery into the inventory -routing problem (IRP)-a more realistic and more challenging operations model. After presenting a mixed integer-linear programming formulation for the IRP with drone (IRP-D), we propose an exact branch-and-cut solution approach for it. Additionally, a heuristic for the problem is designed based on the solution of the basic (i.e., droneless) IRP. Extensive computational results show that the heuristic is effective both as a standalone algorithm and as a warm-starting agent for the branch-and-cut IRP-D algorithm. We also demonstrate the contrast between the IRP-D and the basic IRP. ", "label": "True"}
{"text": "Title: A column-and-row generation approach for the flying sidekick travelling salesman problem Abstract: The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FS-TSP) is a parcel delivery problem arising in the last-mile logistics, where the distribution plan of a driver-operated truck assisted by a drone (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) has to be defined. The FS-TSP is a variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation, where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10 customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some of them never solved before.

{"text": "Title: On the min-cost Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone Abstract: Over the past few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as drones, have been adopted as part of a new logistic method in the commercial sector called \"last-mile delivery\". In this novel approach, they are deployed alongside trucks to deliver goods to customers to improve the quality of service and reduce the transportation cost. This approach gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called TSP with drone (TSP-D). A variant of this problem that aims to minimize the time at which truck and drone finish the service (or, in other words, to maximize the quality of service) was studied in the work of Murray and Chu (2015). In contrast, this paper considers a new variant of TSP-D in which the objective is to minimize operational costs including total transportation cost and one created by waste time a vehicle has to wait for the other. The problem is first formulated mathematically. Then, two algorithms are proposed for the solution. The first algorithm (TSP-LS) was adapted from the approach proposed by Murray and Chu (2015), in which an optimal TSP solution is converted to a feasible TSP-D solution by local searches. The second algorithm, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), is based on a new split procedure that optimally splits any TSP tour into a TSP-D solution. After a TSP-D solution has been generated, it is then improved through local search operators. Numerical results obtained on various instances of both objective functions with different sizes and characteristics are presented. The results show that GRASP outperforms TSP-IS in terms of solution quality under an acceptable running time. ", "label": "True"}

The advent of Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) technology offers a potential revolution in this context. While TLS has been effectively applied to smaller glaciers in the Alps and Tianshan, this study extends its use to the large and topographically complex Ganglongjiama (GLJM) glacier in the Tanggula Mountains. Over a 5-year period, TLS, with a precision of up to 0.012 m, has documented an accelerated melting trend, with the terminus retreating by 13.305 m and a total mass loss of 2.580 m water equivalent. The research also underscores the role of supraglacial channels and lakes in intensifying surface melting and glacier front instability. Despite challenges in data acquisition due to occlusions and logistical constraints at high altitudes, this first TLS survey of a TP glacier provides invaluable insights into glacier dynamics. Future research could integrate TLS with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Structure-from-Motion (UAV-SfM) data fusion to achieve more comprehensive coverage and improve the temporal resolution of observations for a detailed analysis of glacier features.

There have been different methods trying to overcome the AUN task, and most of them have focused on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). But the results were still far from satisfactory, and even if the result was good, the environment was usually too trivial and simple. We report in this paper one of the causes of low success rate for AUN in our previous work, which is the apprehensive behavior of agents. After numerous episodes of training, when the agent faces risky scenes, it often moves back and forth repeatedly until running out of the limited steps. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new role, LifeGuard, into the popular DRL model, Actor-Critic, to tackle the apprehensive behavior and expect a better success rate. In addition, we developed a pilot method of unsupervised classification for sequential data to further enhance our reward function from previous work, augmentative backward reward function. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can eliminate the apprehensive behavior and gain higher success rates than the state-of-the-art method, FORK, with lesser effort.

Consequently, large-sized multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with strong power and ample space show great potential. In order to optimize the design process for large-sized multirotors and reduce physical trial and error, a detailed dynamic model is firstly established, with an accurate aerodynamic model. In addition, the center of gravity (CoG) offset and actuator dynamics are also well considered, which are usually ignored in small-sized multirotors. To improve the endurance and maneuverability of large-sized multirotors, which is the key concern in real applications, a two-loop optimization method for rotor tilt angle design is proposed based on the mathematical model established previously. Its inner loop solves the dynamic equilibrium points to relax the complex dynamic constraints caused by aerodynamics in the overall optimization problem, which improves the solution efficiency. The ideal design results can be obtained through the offline process, which greatly reduces the difficulties of physical trial and error. Finally, various experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the established model and the effectiveness of the optimization method. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: The Piggyback Transportation Problem: Transporting drones launched from a flying warehouse Abstract: This paper treats the Piggyback Transportation Problem: A large vehicle moves successive batches of small vehicles from a depot to a single launching point. Here, the small vehicles depart toward assigned customers, supply shipments, and return to the depot. Once the large vehicle has returned and another batch of small vehicles has been loaded at the depot, the process repeats until all customers are serviced. With autonomous driving on the verge of practical application, this general setting occurs whenever small autonomous delivery vehicles with limited operating range, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) or delivery robots, need to be brought in the proximity of the customers by a larger vehicle, e.g., a truck. We aim at the most elementary decision problem in this context, which is inspired by Amazon's novel last-mile concept, the flying warehouse. According to this concept, drones are launched from a flying warehouse and - after their return to an earthbound depot - are resupplied to the flying warehouse by an air shuttle. We formulate the Piggyback Transportation Problem, investigate its computational complexity, and derive suited solution procedures. From a theoretical perspective, we prove different im portant structural problem properties.

Using drone platforms, satellite images, and historic aerial photographs, we observed the rapid retreat of a permafrost coastline on Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. This coastline is adjacent to a gravel spit accommodating several culturally significant sites and is the logistical base for the Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island Territorial Park operations. In this study we sought to (i) assess short-term coastal erosion dynamics over fine temporal resolution, (ii) evaluate short-term shoreline change in the context of long-term observations, and (iii) demonstrate the potential of low-cost lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (\"drones\") to inform coastline studies and management decisions. We resurveyed a 500 m permafrost coastal reach at high temporal frequency (seven surveys over 40 d in 2017). Intra-seasonal shoreline changes were related to meteorological and oceanographic variables to understand controls on intra-seasonal erosion patterns. To put our short-term observations into historical context, we combined our analysis of shoreline positions in 2016 and 2017 with historical observations from 1952, 1970, 2000, and 2011. In just the summer of 2017, we observed coastal retreat of 14.5 m, more than 6 times faster than the long-term average rate of 2.2 +/- 0.1 ma(-1) (1952-2017). Coastline retreat rates exceeded 1.0 +/- 0.1 md(-1) over a single 4 d period. Over 40 d, we estimated removal of ca. 0.96 m(3) m(-1) d(-1). These findings highlight the episodic nature of shoreline change and the important role of storm events, which are poorly understood along permafrost coastlines.

Previous studies in canola phenology monitoring focused mainly on the flowering stage, using its apparent structure features and colors. Additional phenological stages have been largely overlooked. The objective of this study was to improve a shape-model method (SMM) for extracting winter canola phenological stages from time-series top-of-canopy reflectance images collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The transformation equation of the SMM was refined to account for the multi-peak features of the temporal dynamics of three vegetation indices (VIs) (NDVI, EVI, and CIred-edge). An experiment with various seeding scenarios was conducted, including four different seeding dates and three seeding densities. Three mathematical functions: asymmetric Gaussian function (AGF), Fourier function, and double logistic function, were employed to fit time -series vegetation indices to extract information about phenological stages. The refined SMM effectively estimated the phenological stages of canola, with a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.7 days for all phenological stages. The AGF function provided the best fitting performance, as it captured multi-ple peaks in the growth dynamics characteristics for all seeding date scenarios using four scaling param-eters. For the three selected VIs, CIred-edge achieved the greatest accuracy in estimating the phenological stage dates. This study demonstrates the high potential of the refined SMM for estimating winter canola phenology. (c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

{"text": "Title: Monitoring spring phenology of individual tree crowns using drone-acquired NDVI data Abstract: Quantifying the timing of vegetation phenology is critical for monitoring and modelling ecosystem responses to environmental change. Phenological processes have been studied from landscape to global scales using Earth observing satellite data, and at local scale by in situ surveys of individual plants. Now, data acquired from multi-spectral sensors on drone platforms provide flexible opportunities for monitoring phenology from individual plants to small ecosystem scales efficiently, allowing community and species level information to be derived. We captured a time-series of drone-acquired normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with a multi-spectral sensor (Parrot Sequoia, (Parrot, France)) over a highly heterogeneous ecosystem in Cornwall, UK, during a period of spring green-up. We monitored NDVI trajectories at the individual crown and species' level. For deciduous crowns, we derived metrics representative of spring phenological stages: Start-of-spring (SOS), middle-of-spring green-up (MOG) and start-of-peak greenness (SOP) using a logistic function. While the exact timing of SOS, MOG and SOP appeared susceptible to understorey effects and saturation of the NDVI, relative timing of green-up for a subset of species was plausible in relation to phenological observations from an extended geographic region and in situ plant area index (PAI) measurements. In evergreen vegetation (Pinus spp.) subtle changes were also detected through the growing season. The impact of illumination differences was analysed for image pairs during leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. While significant, these effects were small (mean absolute NDVI deviation of up to 0.034 for leaf-off, 0.013 for leaf-on conditions), meaning that data captured under both constant direct and diffuse irradiance conditions can be used together and that cloudy conditions should not lead to data gaps. We conclude that the capability of drone-mounted multi-spectral instruments for spatio-temporal characterization of crown-level phenology shows great promise for improving the understanding of intra- and inter-species differences in strategy, and offers an efficient means of doing so over areas of a few hectares.

The larger vehicle, which may be a ship or an airplane, is called the mothership; the smaller vehicle, which may be a small boat or unmanned aerial vehicle, is called the drone. We assume that there exists a set of target locations T. For each t in T, the drone must launch from the mothership, visit t, and then return to the mothership to refuel. The drone has a limited range of R time units. In the MDRP, we assume that both mothership and drone operate in the \"open seas\" (i.e., using the Euclidean metric). We also introduce the mothership and infinite-capacity drone routing problem (MDRP-IC), where a drone launches from the mothership and visits one or more targets consecutively before returning to the mothership. Our exact approach uses branch and bound, where each node of the branch-and-bound tree corresponds to a potential subsequence of the order of target visits. A lower bound at each node is given by solving a second-order cone program, which optimally chooses a launch point and landing point for each target in the subsequence. A set of heuristics that also uses a second-order cone program as an embedded procedure is presented. We show that our schemes are flexible to accommodate a variety of additional constraints and/or objective functions.

{"text": "Title: Path and Speed Optimization for Conflict-Free Pickup and Delivery Under Time Windows Abstract: This article introduces a variant of the conflict-free pickup and delivery problem with time windows in which speeds can be regulated. The problem arises in several areas of transportation and logistics including routing and scheduling of automated guided vehicles in port terminals and coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles in controlled airspace. A particular aspect of this problem is that at most one vehicle can traverse an arc of the transportation network at any time. The problem studied in this paper is to determine the vehicle paths and speeds on each arc of the path in such a way that no conflicts arise, the time windows are met, and the total energy consumption is minimized. A branch-and-bound algorithm is described in which a lower bound is obtained by solving a separable nonlinear problem in quadratic time.

Computational experiments show that, when compared with a state-of-the-art approach, the proposed method is able to generate a larger number of feasible solutions (42% on average) and reduce the computation time by an order of magnitude.

Value: Small-world networks and their connectivity facilitate efficient and effective placement of POCT for optimal response, rescue, diagnosis, and treatment. Spatial care paths (TM) speed transport from primary encounters to referral centers bypassing topographic bottlenecks, process gaps, and time-consuming interruptions. Regional GISs position POCT close to where patients live to facilitate rapid triage, decrease therapeutic turnaround time, and conserve economic resources. Geospatial care paths (TM) encompass demographic and population access features. Timeliness creates value during acute illness, complex crises, and unexpected disasters. Isolation laboratories equipped with POCT help stop outbreaks and safely support critically ill patients with highly infectious diseases. POCT-enabled spatial grids can map sentinel cases and establish geographic limits of epidemics for ring vaccination. Impact: Geospatial solutions generate inherently optimal and logical placement of POCT conceptually, physically, and temporally as a means to improve crisis response and spatial resilience. If public health professionals, geospatial scientists, and POCT specialists join forces, new collaborative teamwork can create faster response and higher impact during disasters, complex crises, outbreaks, and epidemics, as well as more efficient primary, urgent, and emergency community care.

{"text": "Title: The multi-visit drone routing problem for pickup and delivery services Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, have gained wide attention in recent years due to their potential of revolutionizing logistics and transportation. In this paper, we consider a variant of the combined truck-drone routing problem, which allows drones to serve multiple customers and provide both pickup and delivery services in each flight. The problem concerns the deployment and routing of a fleet of trucks, each equipped with a supporting drone, to serve all the pickup and delivery demands of a set of customers with minimal total cost. We explicitly model the energy consumption of drones by their travel distance, curb weight and the carrying weight of parcels, develop a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) with problem-customized inequalities, and show a sufficient condition for the benefit of the combined truck-drone mode over the truck-only mode. Considering the complexity of the MILP model, we propose a novel two-stage heuristic algorithm in which a maximum payload method is developed to construct the initial solutions, followed by an improved simulated annealing algorithm with problem-specific neighborhood operators and tailored acceleration strategies. Furthermore, two methods are developed to test the feasibility for both trucks and drones in each solution. The proposed algorithm outperforms two benchmark heuristics in our numerical experiments, which also demonstrate the considerable benefit of allowing multiple visits and both pickup and delivery operations in each drone flight.

{"text": "Title: Integrating drones into NHS patient diagnostic logistics systems: Flight or fantasy? Abstract: Healthcare accounts for approximately 5% of emissions in developed nations, and the public healthcare provider in the United Kingdom (UK), the National Health Service (NHS), has set a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 without detriment to its quality of patient care. With Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs; a.k.a. drones, UAS, or RPAS) starting to be used in healthcare systems outside the UK, there is interest in how they could be integrated into NHS operations to transport diagnostic specimens. Reflecting on a business-as-usual analysis of current NHS diagnostic specimen logistics across the Solent region (southern UK), this paper critically evaluates the practical reality of integrating UAV deliveries of this commodity, identifying the benefits and challenges that must be addressed to realise commercial services, including dangerous goods legislation, cargo stability, routing, and weather. In the analysis, 14 out of 79 surgeries could be realistically served by a 5m wingspan vertical take-off/landing (VTOL) UAV: seven directly, and seven via ground-based transfers. The results suggested that an average of 1,628 samples could be served by UAV each week, resulting in 42 flights/week with 10 taxi services to cover periods where weather limited flying. This equated to an approximate total service cost of 2,964 pound/week if regulations develop to relax UAV personnel constraints. The introduction of UAVs reduced the marginal external costs (greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, and air pollution) by 196 pound per week and cut travel times to UAV served sites by 72% (weather permitting). Tailpipe emissions (excl. taxis), vehicle-kilometres travelled, and van costs were reduced by 20%, 20%, and 23% (respectively), but the overall system cost increased by 56%. Whilst this increase is likely to make the introduction of UAV services financially challenging, the benefits in terms of emissions and journey time savings may offset some of the additional cost and warrant further investigation.

In this study, the Sanjiang Plain was selected, as this area has been experiencing snow drought in the past two decades. Logistic models, combined with multisource remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data, as well as the meteorological data over the past 20 years, were used to calculate sixteen phenological periods and biomass. The results show that (1) over the past two decades, snow drought has been based on the snow accumulation and has been occurring more frequently, wider-ranging and more severely; (2) snow drought has advanced the forest start of season (SOS)/end of season (EOS) by 6/5 days, respectively; (3) if the snowfall is greater than 80% of a normal year, the SOS/EOS of grass is postponed by 8/6 days; conversely, if it is less than 80%, the SOS/EOS are advanced by 7/5 days; and (4) biomass decreased approximately 0.61%, compared with an abundant snowfall year. Overall, this study is the first to explore how snow drought impacts the phenological period in a mid-high latitude area, and more attention should be paid to these unknown risks to the ecosystem.

Growing parcel volumes to be delivered toward customer homes increase the number of delivery vans entering the city centers and thus add to congestion, pollution, and negative health impact. Therefore, it is anything but surprising that in recent years many novel delivery concepts on the last mile have been innovated. Among the most prominent are unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and autonomous delivery robots taking over parcel delivery. This paper surveys established and novel last-mile concepts and puts special emphasis on the decision problems to be solved when setting up and operating each concept. To do so, we systematically record the alternative delivery concepts in a compact notation scheme, discuss the most important decision problems, and survey existing research on operations research methods solving these problems.

{"text": "Title: Assessing Geomorphic Change in Restored Coastal Dune Ecosystems Using a Multi-Platform Aerial Approach Abstract: Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) provide an effective method to examine geomorphic and vegetation change in restored coastal dune ecosystems. Coupling structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry with RGB orthomosaic imagery allows researchers to characterize spatial-temporal geomorphic responses associated with differences in vegetation cover. Such approaches provide quantitative data on landscape morphodynamics and sediment erosion and deposition responses that allow scientists and land managers to assess the efficacy of dynamic restoration efforts and, in turn, make informed decisions for future restoration projects. Two different restored coastal foredune sites in Humboldt County, California were monitored between 2016-20 with UAS (quadcopter and fixed-wing), kite aerial photogrammetry (KAP), and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) platforms. We compared our KAP- and UAS-SfM elevation models to concurrently collected TLS bare earth models for five of our fifteen collections. The goal of this study was to inform on the potential of a multi-platform aerial approach for calculating geomorphic differences (i.e., topographic differencing), in order to quantify sediment erosion and deposition, and vegetation change over a coastal dune ecosystem. While UAS-SfM datasets were relatively well fit to their TLS counterparts (2.1-12.2% area of difference), the KAP-SfM surfaces exhibited higher deviations (23.6-27.6%) and suffered from systematic collection inconsistencies related to methods and susceptibility to external factors (e.g., the influence of wind speed and direction on variable altitude, image overlap, and coverage extent). Finally, we provide commentary on the logistical considerations regarding KAP and UAS data collection and the construction of uncertainty budgets for geomorphic change detection (GCD), while providing suggestions for standardizing methods for uncertainty budgeting. While we propose an approach that incorporates multiple levels of collection- and processing-based uncertainty, we also recognize that uncertainty is often project-specific and outline the development of potential standards for incorporating uncertainty budgets in SfM projects.

{"text": "Title: Vehicle routing with multiple UAVs for the last-mile logistics distribution problem: hybrid distributed optimization Abstract: The logistics market stands to benefit from the accessibility and increased use of new technologies. As technology continues to advance, drones have emerged as a notable innovation. Within the logistics field, there is growing interest in leveraging drones, particularly for handling small and medium-sized orders such as mobile phones. The appeal of drones lies in their economic and environmental advantages, attributed to their reduced energy consumption. These unmanned aerial vehicles are considered a valuable component of the ongoing technological revolution in transportation, with the potential to enhance the efficiency of last-mile deliveries. To explore their applicability, mixed vehicle-drone distribution models have surfaced as a promising alternative to traditional delivery methods. These models enable companies to minimize transportation costs by leveraging the strengths of both vehicles and drones. In this study, we present a solution to the vehicle routing model with multiple drones (VRPm-D). Our objective is to efficiently transport a specified quantity of products from a central depot to customers by devising optimal routes for both trucks and drones. The study focuses on employing a VRPm-D model to facilitate the transportation process, involving a predetermined fleet of vehicles and drones. The vehicles start and end their routes at a central depot. The primary goal is to minimize the time taken by trucks utilizing drones to cater to the needs of every customer effectively while considering the payload capacity and energy endurance constraints of the drones. To address these objectives, we propose a hybrid vehicle-drone routing problem formulated using the genetic clustering algorithm (HVDRP-GCA). This approach aims to optimize the routes and schedules for both vehicles and drones, taking into account the aforementioned constraints. Our results demonstrate that the processing time exponentially increases as the number of customers grows, particularly noticeable in routes with five or more customers. Importantly, the HVDRP-GCA model outperforms existing methods in the literature, providing favorable outcomes.

{"text": "Title: An adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic for the vehicle routing problem with drones Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things, how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of interest. ", "label": "True"}

The broad adoption of sUAS for remote sensing among these groups may be hampered by complex coding, expensive equipment, and time-consuming protocols. We used a consumer sUAS, semiautomated flight planning software, and graphical user interface GIS software to classify grassland vegetation with the aim of providing a user-friendly framework for managers and ecological researchers. We compared the overall accuracy from classifications using this sUAS imagery (89.22%) to classifications using freely available National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery (76.25%) to inform decisions about cost and accuracy. We also compared overall accuracy between manual classification (89.22%) and random forest classification (69.26%) to aid with similar decisions. Finally, we examined the impact of resolution and the addition of a canopy height model on classification accuracy, obtaining mixed results. Our findings can help new users make informed choices about imagery sources and methodologies, and our protocols can serve as a template for those groups wanting to perform similar vegetation classifications on grassland sites without the need for survey-grade equipment or coding.

This study aims to investigate the safety of pedestrians with a new perspective that focuses on consecutive conflicts occurring during pedestrian crossing. Based on about 9 h video data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle from six unsignalized crosswalks of a roundabout, consecutive conflicts were identified, and an integrated severity index that combines post encroachment time, jerk and yaw rate ratio was proposed to measure the severity of consecutive conflicts. Moreover, bivariate logistic models that account for and not account for the correlation between the pedestrianmotorized vehicle (P-MV) conflict and the pedestrian-non-motorized vehicle (P-NV) conflict of a consecutive conflict were developed, and speed-, count-, time to zebra-related factors and other factors of involved road users were considered in the models. A total of 899 consecutive conflicts were identified and on average one in six pedestrians encountered consecutive conflicts. The bivariate logistic modeling results show that the model accounting for the correlation significantly outperform its counterpart. A negative correlation is found between the severities of P-MV conflict and P-NV conflict, and the P-NV conflict is more likely to be the serious one. It is also found that speed of motorized vehicle and time to zebra for the first conflicting subject are the common factors that affect the severities of both P-NV conflicts and P-MV conflicts, while speed of pedestrian, speed of nonmotorized vehicle, number of motorized vehicles, number of non-motorized vehicles, group and direction of pedestrians have significant effects on the severity of either P-MV conflicts or P-NV conflicts.

However, research that investigates the coupling relationship between surface subsidence in mountainous regions and the occurrence of multiple surface hazards is scarce. Taking a coal mine in southwestern China as a case study, a detailed catalog of the surface hazards in the study area was created based on multi-temporal satellite imagery interpretation and Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology and the logistic subsidence prediction method, this study investigated the evolution of surface subsidence induced by underground mining activities and its impact on the triggering of multiple surface hazards. We found that the study area experienced various types of surface hazards, including subsidence, landslides, debris flows, sinkholes, and ground fissures, due to the effects of underground mining activities. The InSAR monitoring results showed that the maximum subsidence at the back edge of the slope terrace was 98.2 mm, with the most severe deformation occurring at the mid-slope of the mountain, where the maximum subsidence reached 139.8 mm. The surface subsidence process followed an S-shaped curve, comprising the stages of initial subsidence, accelerated subsidence, and residual subsidence. Additionally, the subsidence continued even after coal mining operations concluded. Predictions derived from the logistic model indicate that the duration of residual surface subsidence in the study area is approximately 1 to 2 years. This study aimed to provide a scientific foundation for elucidating the temporal and spatial variation patterns of subsidence induced by underground coal mining in mountainous regions and its impact on the formation of multiple surface hazards.

A mixed integer mathematical model is developed for the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, a single-truck-multi-drone problem by considering technical and energy issues. Two different objective functions are used in the model. The first objective function is to minimize the sum of arrival times. Minimizing the sum of arrival times for customers also minimizes the distance traveled by the vehicles and, accordingly, the cost. The second objective function is to minimize total tardiness. A dataset is generated to test the proposed model. Trade-offs between the results for the two objective functions are analyzed. The technical requirements of the drone, energy limits, and fleet size are considered in the proposed mathematical model. The effects of the flight ranges of the drones are investigated with respect to the energy constraint. It has been observed that changes in the number of customers and drones affect the results of the objective functions. The total arrival time and tardiness decreased with increasing number of drones.

The present study analysed eight typical villages in Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, China, as examples. A combination of high-resolution remote sensing images and farm household survey data were used to explore the abandonment of terraces in mountainous areas. A multi-level logistic model was constructed to analyse the determinants of terrace abandonment based on three levels: plot, household and village. The results show that serious terrace abandonment occurred in the study area, with 33.78% of all terraces having been abandoned. The plot and household levels were important in influencing terrace abandonment by farmers. At the plot level, terrace abandonment is more likely to occur on small plots found at a long distance from residences with poor irrigation conditions and collapsed ridges. At the household level, households where the head had a relatively high level of education and households with relatively small agricultural labour forces and lower degrees of mechanisation had a higher probability of their terraces being abandoned. At the village level, a relatively high risk of terrace abandonment was found in villages relatively close to an administrative centre, with a low land transfer rate and a low rate of forest coverage. In conclusion, carrying out land consolidation projects and improving agricultural infrastructure in mountainous areas are important means to achieving the sustainable use of terraces.

{"text": "Title: Maximum coverage capacitated facility location problem with range constrained drones Abstract: Given a set of demand and potential facility locations and a set of fully available charged drones, an agency seeks to locate a pre-specified number of capacitated facilities and assign drones to the located facilities to serve the demands. The facilities serve as drone launching sites for distributing the resources. Each drone makes several one-to-one trips from the facility location to the demand points and back until the battery range is met. The planning period is short-term and therefore the recharging of drone batteries is not considered. This paper presents an integer linear programming formulation with the objective of maximizing coverage while explicitly incorporating the drone energy consumption and range constraints. The new formulation is called the Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones or simply MCFLPD. The MCFLPD is a complex problem and even for relatively small problem sizes a state of the art MIP solver may require unacceptably long running times to find feasible solutions. Computational efficiency of MCFLPD solutions is a key factor since conditions associated with customer demands or weather conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed) may change suddenly and require a fast global reoptimization. To better balance solution quality and running times novel greedy and three-stage heuristics (3SH) are developed. The 3SH is based on decomposition and local exchange principles and involves a facility location and allocation problem, multiple knapsack subproblems, and a final local random search stage. On average the 3SH solutions are within 5% of the best Gurobi solutions but at a small fraction of the running time.

Fieldwork was performed throughout the breeding seasons of 2017-2019. Each year, one colony of black-headed gull was studied, and it was visited weekly for 4 weeks after laying to compare the relative effectiveness and safety for the monitored birds using both methods, i.e., ground vs. drone counts. No significant differences were found in the number of both eggs and hatchings (n = 543) per nest between the two methods. The average coefficient of agreement between the methods was high for all comparisons. Overall, 224.2 min were spent on censusing the three colonies by the traditional approach vs. 30.6 min by the drone method (- 86.4%). An additional 92.6 min were needed for the drone approach to process recorded videos. The mean time spent measuring the hatching success of the three colonies with a drone was far less, about 84.6% less, than that with the traditional approach.

Time-series RGB and multispectral data obtained with UAVs can be used for revealing changes of three-dimensional growth. We previously showed using a rice population with our regular cultivation protocol that canopy height (CH) parameters extracted from time-series RGB data are useful for predicting manually measured traits such as days to heading (DTH), culm length (CL), and aboveground dried weight (ADW). However, whether CH parameters are applicable to other rice populations and to different cultivation methods, and whether vegetation indices such as the chlorophyll index green (CIg) can function for phenotype prediction remain to be elucidated. Here we show that CH and CIg exhibit different patterns with different cultivation protocols, and each has its own character for the prediction of rice phenotypes. We analyzed CH and CIg time-series data with a modified logistic model and a double logistic model, respectively, to extract individual parameters for each. The CH parameters were useful for predicting DTH, CL, ADW and stem and leaf weight (SLW) in a newly developed rice population under both regular and delayed cultivation protocols. The CIg parameters were also effective for predicting DTH and SLW, and could also be used to predict panicle weight (PW). The predictive ability worsened when different cultivation protocols were used, but this deterioration was mitigated by a calibration procedure using data from parental cultivars.

{"text": "Title: Consumer preferences for innovative and traditional last-mile parcel delivery Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this research is to reveal consumer preferences towards innovative last-mile parcel delivery and more specifically unmanned aerial delivery drones, in comparison to traditional postal delivery (postie) and the recent rise of parcel lockers in Australia. The authors investigate competitive priorities and willingness to pay for key attributes of parcel delivery (mode, speed, method and time window), the role of contextual moderators such as parcel value and security and opportunities for logistics service providers in the growing e-commerce market. Design/methodology/approach A survey involving stated choice experiments has been conducted among 709 respondents in urban Australia. The authors estimated panel error component logit models, derived consumer priorities and deployed 576 Monte Carlo simulations to forecast potential delivery mode market shares. Findings The study results suggest that people prefer postie over drone delivery, all else equal, but that drone deliveries become competitive with large market shares if they live up to the premise that they can deliver faster and cheaper. Both drone and postie become less attractive relative to parcel lockers when there is no safe place to leave a parcel at a residence, highlighting the importance of situational context and infrastructure at the receiving end of last-mile delivery. The authors identified opportunities for chargeable add-on services, such as signature for postie and 2-h parcel deliveries for drones. Originality/value The authors offer timely and novel insights into consumers preferences towards aerial drone parcel deliveries compared to postie and lockers. Going beyond the extant engineering/operations research literature, the authors provide a starting point and add new dimensions/moderators for last-mile parcel delivery choice analysis and empirical evidence of market potential and competitive attributes of innovative versus traditional parcel delivery alternatives.

{"text": "Title: Detecting coffee leaf rust with UAV-based vegetation indices and decision tree machine learning models Abstract: Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is one of the most devastating leaf diseases in coffee plantations. By knowing the symptoms, severity, and spatial distribution of CLR, farmers can improve disease management procedures and reduce losses associated with it. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-based images, in conjunction with machine learning (ML) techniques, helped solve multiple agriculture-related problems. In this sense, vegetation indices processed with ML algorithms are a promising strategy. It is still a challenge to map severity levels of CLR using remote sensing data and an ML approach. Here we propose a framework to detect CLR severity with only vegetation indices extracted from UAV imagery. For that, we based our approach on decision tree models, as they demonstrated important results in related works. We evaluated a coffee field with different infestation classes of CLR: class 1 (from 2% to 5% rust); class 2 (from 5% to 10% rust); class 3 (from 10% to 20% rust), and; class 4 (from 20% to 40% rust). We acquired data with a Sequoia camera, producing images with a spatial resolution of 10.6 cm, in four spectral bands: green (530-570 nm), red (640-680 nm), red-edge (730-740 nm), and nearinfrared (770-810 nm). A total of 63 vegetation indices was extracted from the images, and the following learners were evaluated in a cross-validation method with 10 folders: Logistic Model Tree (LMT); J48; ExtraTree; REPTree; Functional Trees (FT); Random Tree (RT), and; Random Forest (RF). The results indicated that the LMT method contributed the most to the accurate prediction of early and several infestation classes. For these classes, LMT returned F-measure values of 0.915 and 0.875, thus being a good indicator of early CLR (2 to 5% of rust) and later stages of CLR (20 to 40% of rust). We demonstrated a valid approach to model rust in coffee plants using only vegetation indices and ML algorithms, specifically for the disease's early and later stages. We concluded that the proposed framework allows inferring the predicted classes in remaining plants within the sampled area, thus helping the identification of potential CLR in non-sampled plants. We corroborate that the decision tree-based model may assist in precision agriculture practices, including mapping rust in coffee plantations, providing both an efficient non-invasive and spatially continuous monitoring of the disease.

{"text": "Title: Drone delivery and consumer behavior in last mile logistics: an empirical study in South Korea Abstract: Despite the great potential that drone technology can bring to last-mile logistics, consumers' intent to use it appears to be lower than expected. Therefore, this study investigated the factors influencing consumers' intentions to use drone delivery. A theoretical model based on value-belief-norm theory was developed and tested with structural equation modeling based on data collected from 458 Korean consumers. The results suggest that the environmental protection, economic, and altruistic values of drone delivery positively impact consumers' perceptions of responsibility. In addition, the ascription of responsibility positively influences consumers' personal norms. Finally, personal norms are found to increase consumers' intentions to use drone delivery, and the impact is positively moderated by moral obligation. This study employs the extended value-belief-norm (VBN) framework and makes a valuable contribution to the existing body of literature. Furthermore, this study employs the VBN model to ascertain the ecological advantages associated with environmentally sustainable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Additionally, it provides valuable practical implications for professionals and policymakers in the field. ", "label": "True"}

The use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for package deliveries offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility, efficiency, speed, safety, and even few environmental gains. However, the drones can come across various security hazards while communicating with ground installations on open channels including physical capture attack, privacy infringement, and so on. Thus, earnest endeavors are needed to fix those security challenges in applications related to drone communications. To address these problems, an efficient authenticated key agreement technique, drone access control scheme for last mile delivery (DAC-MD) is suggested for user-drone interactions in IoD environment that help the participating entities in developing a mutually agreed session key for securing subsequent communication interactions. The proposed scheme is proved using automated ProVerif tool as well as analyzed by using formal analysis based on RoR random oracle model. The comparative analysis against recently presented known studies reveals that our scheme not only carries comparable properties in terms of security and privacy, but also low computational and communication costs.

Vaccinating livestock is one of the most sustainable strategies to mitigate the impact of RVF on health and livelihoods. However, vaccine supply chain constraints severely limit the effectiveness of vaccination programs. In the human health sector, unmanned aerial vehicles, i.e., drones, are increasingly used to improve supply chains and last-mile vaccine delivery. We investigated perceptions of whether delivering RVF vaccines by drone in Rwanda might help to overcome logistical constraints in the vaccine supply chain. We conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the animal health sector and Zipline employees in Nyagatare District in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. We used content analysis to identify key themes. We found that stakeholders in the animal health sector and Zipline employees believe that drones could improve RVF vaccination in Nyagatare.

{"text": "Title: Genetic algorithm for scheduling of parcel delivery by drones Abstract: In recent years, efficient logistics has become indispensable, and using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones is promising for considerably reducing the cost and time required for parcel delivery. This paper addresses a parcel delivery scheduling problem. In this problem, a truck loaded with drones and parcels leaves a distribution center and stops at some points on a fixed route. At each point, the drones take off and deliver parcels to customers. We define this problem as finding the assignment of customers to both the drones and their takeoff points. Then, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) for finding a near-optimal solution in a short time. In the proposed GA, a solution is represented using sets of customers assigned to the takeoff points, and a heuristic rule determines the assignment to the drones. The crossover operation enables offspring to inherit the customer sets. Experimental results show that the proposed GA can successfully find an optimal or a near-optimal solution faster than an integer programming solver for almost all instances. In addition, it significantly outperforms other GAs using a different crossover. ", "label": "True"}

{"text": "Title: Robust drone selective routing in humanitarian transportation network assessment Abstract: Assessing a humanitarian transportation network at an early stage after disaster occurrence plays a cru-cial role in the mitigation of casualties. As a class of uncrewed aerial vehicles, drones have the potential to perform such assessment operations. We consider a drone arc routing problem in which road segments are evaluated selectively with the goal of maximizing the collected arc informative profits within a pre-defined time limit. The problem allows drones to travel between nodes without following the physical road network; i.e., drones can travel along the road network for assessment purposes, but they can also travel off the network to save travel time. This feature raises a novel challenge compared to the conven-tional arc routing problem, as multiple edges exist between two nodes, with different corresponding ben-efits. To address this challenge, a graph transformation technique is presented in which the multigraph-based arc routing problem is reduced to a node-based routing problem on a simple graph. Due to the significant uncertainties and limited information regarding the post-disaster transportation network, the problem is modeled as a new variant of a robust team orienteering problem with uncertain assessment time. Since the original robust formulation is intractable, we leverage path-based reformulation and ap-ply Lagrangian decomposition to the robust counterpart, which allows us to solve the robust subproblem efficiently through a series of deterministic auxiliary problems. We propose an efficient exact branch -and-price (B&P) framework to solve this problem exactly. In computational experiments, we examine the efficiency of our solution approach using various instances, including instances generated from real-world data as well as simulation, to demonstrate its practical applicability. The results show that compared with the traditional arc orienteering problem, our model achieves an approximately 30% improvement in the objective value.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

{"text": "Title: Using intermediate points in parcel delivery operations with truck-based autonomous drones Abstract: Autonomous drones are no longer science fiction but are becoming reality. Prior studies have investigated how an autonomous drone can be used in conjunction with a parcel delivery truck, but they all restricted the drones' launch/recovery sites to customer nodes visited by a truck. In practice, parcel carriers are considering the use of intermediate points (IPs), the sites found along the arcs connecting customer nodes, as drones' launch/recovery points. This means that the academic literature currently lags the industry practice. This article extends the previous works on truck-and-drone last-mile delivery by investigating the conditions under which the use of IPs is beneficial by using both theoretical and empirical approaches. Our results show that, although using IPs is an effective concept that can save the cost (time) of package deliveries by 2.189% on average, the cost saving realized by using IPs can vary notably across carriers depending on their network characteristics. Specifically, our results suggest that the benefit of using IPs becomes high when a network has the following characteristics: (1) low customer density (a small number of customers served per square mile), and (2) large number of time-sensitive packages (subject to time window constraints). Based on these findings, we provide normative implications on if, when, where, and to what extent IPs can be beneficial for the truck-and-drone joint operations in last-mile logistics.

Traditional post-construction monitoring of marshes involves in situ vegetation sampling and aerial imagery from fixed-wing occupied aircraft, but these methods can be logistically intensive and limited in spatial and temporal resolution. To address these limitations, we evaluated the use of Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS) in post-construction monitoring of the Lake Hermitage Marsh Creation Project in Plaquemine Parish, Louisiana, as a case study. Specifically, we used UAS-derived habitat classification maps to compare vegetation cover between created and reference (i.e., natural) marsh sites and conducted a power analysis to quantify the number of in situ plots needed to reliably characterize site-wide vegetation cover. Habitat classification accuracies of UAS-derived maps ranged from 77.9 to 84.5% with slightly lower accuracies at created relative to reference marsh sites due to their more heterogenous vegetation cover. UAS-derived maps discriminated between created and reference marsh sites based on vegetation community similarity, while in situ vegetation monitoring plots did not. Furthermore, our case study illustrates the ability of UAS-based habitat and vegetation classifications to complement, inform, and optimize plot-based, in situ vegetation sampling in future post-construction marsh monitoring plans.

{"text": "Title: Routing for unmanned aerial vehicles: Touring dimensional sets Abstract: In this paper we deal with an extension of the crossing postman problem to design routes that have to visit different shapes of dimensional elements rather than edges. This problem models the design of routes of drones or other vehicles that must visit a number of geographical elements to deliver some good or service and then move directly to the next using straight line displacements. We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second family of formulations is not time-dependent, instead it uses connectivity properties to ensure the proper definition of routes. We compare them on a testbed of instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone (SOC) representable and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational results reported in this paper show that our models are useful and our formulations can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems including neighborhoods that have already been studied in the literature. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and Variable Neighborhood Search. This algorithm performs very well since it provides promising feasible solutions and, in addition, it can be used to initialize the solvers with feasible solutions. (c) 2021 The Authors.

{"text": "Title: Identification and Factor Analysis of Traffic Conflicts in the Merge Area of Freeway Work Zone Abstract: The merge areas of freeway work zones include relatively significant safety hazards that have continuously led to urgent safety issues to be solved by the management departments. In order to make up for the cumbersome process of independent identification of rear-end collisions and lane change collisions on complex road sections, an appropriate identification method of traffic conflicts in the merge area of freeway work zone was explored, this study collected vehicle running tracking data from the merge areas of multiple work zones, using an unmanned aerial vehicle video technique. Based on an inter-frame difference method and the principle of a spatio-temporal context visual tracking algorithm, the vehicles were detected and tracked, and the coordinate data of the vehicles in continuous motion were parsed using MATLAB 2018b extension tools. Based on the behavior characteristics of vehicle conflict avoidance, a new identification method for evading severe traffic conflicts is proposed according to the initial velocity, acceleration, and accident rate of section traffic. Then, a statistical analysis was performed on the spatial distribution characteristics of the traffic conflicts in typical merge areas. The impacts of the road conditions in work zones, vehicle factors, and traffic flow factors on traffic conflicts were analyzed. A binomial logistic model was established to identify the main influencing factors. The results show that in the merge area of the freeway work zone, there are serious traffic conflicts between vehicles in the following two situations: (I) v ? [7,13.5] m/s and a ? [-3.96,-0.65] m/s(2); and (II) v ? [13.5,24.3] m/s, and a ? [-3.96,-1.57] m/s(2). The probabilities of serious traffic conflicts in the first and last 25 m of the merge area are greater than those in the other sections. The smaller the space between the upstream work zone and the merge area, the greater the probability of serious traffic conflicts between vehicles. When the average vehicle speed is relatively high, the probability of serious conflicts is the highest, i.e., by a multiple of 5.95 from the baseline. Moreover, the probability of serious conflicts between vehicles is higher for larger vehicles, i.e., 4.765 times that for small vehicles. The research results can serve as a reference for freeway management departments to improve the safety levels of merge areas during road work. For example, the probability of serious conflicts can be effectively reduced by setting up reasonable speed limit signs in the work zone, increasing the spacing between the work zone and merge area, and appropriately diverting large vehicles.

We investigated patterns of UAS use and associated outcomes across practices in Michigan within a quality improvement collaborative. Methods: The Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) Reducing Operative Complications from Kidney Stones (ROCKS) initiative maintains a web-based, prospective clinical registry of patients undergoing URS for urinary stone disease (USD). We analyzed all patients undergoing primary URS for renal and ureteral stones from June 2016 to July 2018 in the ROCKS registry. We determined rates of UAS usage across practices and associated outcomes, including 30-day emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalization, as well as stone-free rates. Using multivariate logistical regression, we determined the predictors of UAS use as well as outcomes, including stone-free rates, ED visits, and hospitalizations, associated with UAS use. Results: Of the 5316 URS procedures identified, UASs were used in 1969 (37.7%) cases. Stones were significantly larger and more likely to be located in the kidney in cases with UAS use. UAS use during URS varied greatly across practices (1.9%-96%, p < 0.05). After adjusting for clinical and surgical risk factors, UAS use significantly increased the odds of postoperative ED visits (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.93, p < 0.05) and hospitalization (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.22-2.56, p < 0.05) as well as decreased the odds of being stone free (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99, p < 0.05). Conclusions: In the current study, UAS use during URS for USD was not associated with an increased likelihood of being stone free; moreover, it increased the odds of a postoperative ED visit and or hospitalization. Our findings demonstrate that UAS use is not without risk and should be employed judiciously. ", "label": "False"}

Although other fields of application received higher levels of support, a majority of the respondents were positive towards using drones for healthcare logistics. Transportation of medicine and blood samples between hospitals were the most accepted healthcare use cases. Support varies across age with the highest support found in the eldest age group. Also, themore citizens report to know about drones, the more they tend to support using them.

We evaluated sUAS pilot states during the tactical response to the 2018 Kilauea Volcano Lower East Rift Zone event, using a 3-minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) and wrist worn heart rate sensor. The field data, collected over four days, indicated that the sUAS pilots did not recover to baseline vigilance and physiological levels. Some pilots stopped participating over time, owing to logistical constraints of performing the 3-minute PVT test. Additionally, all pilots refrained from rating their perceived workload levels. We summarize the utility of and challenges associated with collecting performance, physiological, and subjective measures of pilot fatigue during real disaster response. Background: Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), which provide remote presence at disasters, are teleoperated by emergency responders who experience elevated fatigue levels exacerbated by disrupted sleep/rest schedule as a mission unfolds.

{"text": "Title: Optimizing the Scale of Observation for Intertidal Habitat Classification through Multiscale Analysis Abstract: Monitoring intertidal habitats, such as oyster reefs, salt marshes, and mudflats, is logistically challenging and often cost- and time-intensive. Remote sensing platforms, such as unoccupied aircraft systems (UASs), present an alternative to traditional approaches that can quickly and inexpensively monitor coastal areas. Despite the advantages offered by remote sensing systems, challenges remain concerning the best practices to collect imagery to study these ecosystems. One such challenge is the range of spatial resolutions for imagery that is best suited for intertidal habitat monitoring. Very fine imagery requires more collection and processing times. However, coarser imagery may not capture the fine-scale patterns necessary to understand relevant ecological processes. This study took UAS imagery captured along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Florida, USA, and resampled the derived orthomosaic and digital surface model to resolutions ranging from 3 to 31 cm, which correspond to the spatial resolutions achievable by other means (e.g., aerial photography and certain commercial satellites). A geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) workflow was then applied to datasets at each resolution to classify mudflats, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and water. The GEOBIA process was conducted within R, making the workflow open-source. Classification accuracies were largely consistent across the resolutions, with overall accuracies ranging from 78% to 82%. The results indicate that for habitat mapping applications, very fine resolutions may not provide information that increases the discriminative power of the classification algorithm. Multiscale classifications were also conducted and produced higher accuracies than single-scale workflows, as well as a measure of uncertainty between classifications. ", "label": "False"}

The irrigation doses were 50, 70, 85, and 100 % of the actual evapotranspiration (ETc). The experiment was performed in the Peruvian Arid Coastal Region (13.10 S, 76.37 W). On-ground destructive plant measurements (7 times) allowed to obtain the leaf area index (LAI) and the canopy equivalent water thickness (EWTcanopy) to validate the experiment. Similarly, volumetric soil moisture was monitored at three hours interval using time-domain reflectometry. High-resolution multispectral imagery was acquired along the growing season (10 times) using an unmanned aerial vehicle. NDVI at plant level was obtained based on oversegmented imagery. The canopy NDVI growth curves were obtained in relation to the irrigation treatments and growing degree days (GDD) using a nonlinear mixed model. Deficit irrigation doses (50, 70 and 85 % ETc) induced lower biomass accumulation and greatly affected LAI and EWTcanopy, attaining lower values (p < 0.05) than the control (100 % ETc). In spite of reaching higher LAI and EWTcanopy values, 70 % ETc was not significantly different from 50 % ETc (p < 0.05) showing the difficulty to accurately discriminate treatments with high deficit irrigation; 85 % ETc produced important differences on EWTcanopy and LAI compared to the other deficit irrigation treatments (p < 0.05) due to a higher leaf area expansion. Deficit irrigation doses led to less vigorous plants resulting in lower NDVI compared to the control. Notwithstanding 50 % ETc obtained lower NDVI values than 70 % ETc, differences were not significant. Volumetric soil moisture was consistent with the irrigation treatments, resulting in a decreased trend with decreasing water application along the growing season. A three-parameter logistic mixed model was found to be well-suited to fit the tomato canopy NDVI growth curves in function of the irrigation treatments (i.e. fixed effects) considering the plant-specific variability (i.e. random effects). At maturity stage, significant differences of the deficit irrigation treatments from the control were obtained (p < 0.05) when cumulative effect of the treatments was well-defined and NDVI reached asymptotic behavior. During the vegetative stage, the inflection point marked the fastest NDVI growth rate for the 100 % ETc treatment whereas the lowest for the 50 % ETc (p < 0.05). The diagnosis plots and the low root mean squared error of the residuals indicated the suitability of using the three-parameter logistic growth curve estimated as a nonlinear mixed model to predict NDVI.

Here, we propose a procedure of using uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) to obtain successive phenotype data for growth analysis. The objectives of this study were to obtain high-temporal UAS-based phenotype data for growth analysis and investigate the correlation between the UAS-based phenotype and biomass yield. Seven different energy cane genotypes were grown in a random complete block design with four replications. Twenty-six UAS flight missions were flown throughout the growing season, and canopy cover (CC) and canopy height (CH) measurements were extracted. A five-parameter logistic (5PL) function was fitted through these temporal measurements of CC and CH. The first- and second-order derivatives of this function were calculated to obtain several growth parameters, which were then used to assess the growth of different genotypes with respect to weed competitiveness and biomass yield traits. The results show that CC and CH growth rates significantly differed among genotypes. TH16-16 was outstanding for its ground cover growth; therefore, it was identified as a weed-competitive genotype. Furthermore, TH16-22 had a higher CH maximum growth rate per day, yielding a higher biomass compared to other genotypes. The CH-based multi-temporal data as well as the growth parameters had a better relationship with biomass yield.

The total laboratory activity was analyzed per min for the complete year of 2018. The time from the clinical ordering of tests to the loading of the drone, drone transport time, and analysis time after the sample arrived at the analyzing laboratory were assessed using the lead time of emergency analyses of C-reactive protein, troponin, and the international normalized ratio. The activity had characteristic diurnal patterns, with the most intensive traffic between 8 and 12 a.m. on weekdays and there being considerably less traffic for the rest of the day, at night and on weekends. Drone schedules with departures 15-60 min apart were simulated. A maximum of 15 min between flights was required to meet the emergency demand for the analyses being completed within 60 min. The required drone weight capacity was below 3.5 kg at all times. In multiple simulations, the drone times were appropriate, whereas variations in the clinic- and laboratory-related time intervals caused violations of the allowed time 50% of the time. Drone transport with regular schedules may potentially improve the transport time compared with traditional ground transport and allow the merging of large laboratories, even when the demand for emergency analyses restricts the maximum transport time.

{"text": "Title: Noncontact Dynamic Three-Component Displacement Measurement with a Dual Stereovision-Enabled Uncrewed Aerial System Abstract: Measuring the dynamic displacements of a structure provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure, especially when subjected to different types of dynamic loading (i.e., wind, traffic, impact loads, blast loads, etc.). Despite their usefulness, direct displacement measurements are typically not collected due to the cumbersome logistical issues of sensor placement and maintenance and the impracticality of instrumenting contact-based sensors across all significant structures. In this context, this study proposes a novel dual stereovision technique to measure the dynamic displacement of structures using a portable, noncontact measurement system that involves an uncrewed aerial system (UAS) and four optical cameras. One pair of cameras tracks the three-component (x, y, and z) motion of a region of interest (ROI) on a structure with respect to the UAS system, and the other pair of cameras measure the six degrees of freedom motion (6-DOF) (both rotational and translational motion) of the UAS system by tracking a stationary reference. The motion of the UAS is then compensated for to recover the true dynamic displacement of the ROI. The proposed dual stereovision technique realizes simultaneous measurement of all three components of displacements of the structure and 6-DOF of UAS motion through a mathematically elegant process. The unique dual stereovision technique allows flexibility in choosing a global reference coordinate system, greatly enhancing the feasibility of applying the new technology in various field environments. This new technique has overcome the major challenge of significant UAS motions in full-scale applications. Furthermore, this technique relies on natural features and eliminates the requirement of artificial targets on the structure, permitting applications to difficult-to-access structures.

{"text": "Title: Drone scheduling model for delivering small parcels to remote islands considering wind direction and speed Abstract: The logistics infrastructure in urban areas has been gradually strengthened; however, delivery demand on small islands or in mountainous regions might not be met in a timely manner because of intrinsic geographical conditions. However, with the rapid development of drone-related technologies (i.e., small unmanned aerial vehicles), drone-based parcel delivery is considered a viable alternative for delivery to such areas. In this paper, we propose a drone scheduling model to maximize the minimum delivery amount to the target islands. In particular, a robust optimization is adopted to consider the uncertainties of wind direction and speed. To capture the impact of wind on the performance of the proposed scheduling models, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. Moreover, we performed validation experiments with real weather data to determine the feasibility of the proposed models and cross-check the sensitivity analysis results. The results indicate that the proposed robust optimization-based approach achieves better performance than the deterministic model under strengthening wind conditions. Stronger wind corresponds to a better performance of the proposed model. Also, a cost analysis was conducted to support the usage of drones for parcel delivery to remote islands, and it showed that the longer the drone-based delivery is operated, the more operation costs can be saved in comparison with the current practice.

{"text": "Title: Drones for parcel and passenger transport: A qualitative exploration of public acceptance Abstract: Civil and commercial drones are on the verge of becoming a key technology of future everyday life. Stimulated by recent technological progress and increasing regulatory clarity especially larger cities are anticipated to use drones for parcel and passenger transport hoping to relieve congested inner city traffic. Despite it is first and foremost the urban population that would be affected by accessing lower airspace, only few studies addressed the public perception of using transport drones. Aiming to fill the gap of attitudinal and acceptance research in the context of drones, the article embraces the subject by presenting qualitative results of a series of five focus groups conducted in three German cities. The analysis of discussions shows that participants were largely ambivalent towards the use of drones, putting special emphasis on a variety of object-related factors (safety and security, sustainability, usefulness), subject-related factors (general perception of technology) and also context-related factors (potential societal implications of drone technology). Framed by a discussion of identified acceptance factors in the context of the present scientific debate and assessing drones' potential social implications the article provides a profound qualitative exploration into one of the most disruptive and controversial future technologies that may transform both the transport world and urban societies.

We tried to answer this research question through a case study for Johnsons and Hurd glaciers, Livingston Island, using a fixed-wing RPAS, in particular, a Trimble UX5 UAV with electric pusher propeller by brushless 700 W motor, chosen for its ability to fly long distances and reach inaccessible areas. We also evaluated the accuracy of the point clouds and digital surface models (DSM) generated by aerial photogrammetry in our case study. The results were validated against ground control points taken by differential GNSS techniques, showing an accuracy of 0.16 +/- 0.12 m in the vertical coordinate. Various hypotheses were proposed and flight-tested, based on variables affecting the flight operation and the data collection, namely, gusty winds, low temperatures, battery life, camera configuration, and snow reflectivity. We aim to provide some practical guidelines that can help other researchers using fixed-wing drones under climatic conditions similar to those of the South Shetland Islands. Performance of the drone under harsh weather conditions, the logistical considerations, and the amount of snow at the time of data collection are factors driving the necessary modifications from those of conventional flight operations.

{"text": "Title: An automated work-flow for pinniped surveys: A new tool for monitoring population dynamics Abstract: Detecting changes in population trends depends on the accuracy of estimated mean population growth rates and thus the quality of input data. However, monitoring wildlife populations poses economic and logistic challenges especially in complex and remote habitats. Declines in wildlife populations can remain undetected for years unless effective monitoring techniques are developed, guiding appropriate management actions. We developed an automated survey workflow using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to quantify the number and size of individual animals, using the well-studied Scandinavian harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) as a model species. We compared ground-based counts using telescopes with manual flights, using a zoom photo/video, and pre-programmed flights producing orthomosaic photo maps. We used machine learning to identify and count both pups and older seals and we present a new method for measuring body size automatically. We evaluate the population's reproductive success using drone data, historical counts and predictions from a Leslie matrix population model. The most accurate and time-efficient results were achieved by performing pre-programmed flights where individual seals are identified by machine learning and their body sizes are measured automatically. The accuracy of the machine learning detector was 95-97% and the classification error was 4.6 +/- 2.9 for pups and 3.1 +/- 2.1 for older seals during good light conditions. There was a clear distinction between the body sizes of pups and older seals during breeding time. We estimated 320 pups in the breeding season 2021 with the drone, which is well beyond the expected number, based on historical data on pup production. The new high quality data from the drone survey confirms earlier indications of a deteriorating reproductive rate in this important harbour seal colony. We show that aerial drones and machine learning are powerful tools for monitoring wildlife in inaccessible areas which can be used to assess annual recruitment and seasonal variations in body condition.

The objectives of this study were to identify the initial day of anthesis (IA(DAS)) of soybean varieties based on remote sensing multispectral time-series images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and analyze the differences in the initial anthesis of the same soybean varieties between two different climatic regions, Shijiazhuang (SJZ) and Xuzhou (XZ). First, the temporal dynamics of several key crop growth indicators and spectral indices were analyzed to find an effective indicator that favors the identification of IA(DAS), including leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (AGB), canopy height (CH), normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI), red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), green normalized-difference vegetation index (GNDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and normalized-difference red-edge index (NDRE). Next, this study compared several functions, like the symmetric gauss function (SGF), asymmetric gauss function (AGF), double logistic function (DLF), and fourier function (FF), for time-series curve fitting, and then estimated the IA(DAS) of soybean varieties with the first-order derivative maximal feature (FDmax) of the CIred edge phenology curves. The relative thresholds of the CIred edge curves were also used to estimate IA(DAS), in two ways: a single threshold for all of the soybean varieties, and three different relative thresholds for early, middle, and late anthesis varieties, respectively. Finally, this study presented the variations in the IA(DAS) of the same soybean varieties between two different climatic regions and discussed the probable causal factors. The results showed that CIred edge was more suitable for soybean IA(DAS) identification compared with the other investigated indicators because it had no saturation during the whole crop lifespan. Compared with DLF, AGF and FF, SGF provided a better fitting of the CIred edge time-series curves without overfitting problems, although the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were not the best. The FDmax of the SGF-fitted CIred edge curve (SGF_CIred edge) provided good estimates of the IA(DAS), with an RMSE and mean average error (MAE) of 3.79 days and 3.00 days, respectively. The SGF-fitted_CIred edge curve can be used to group the soybean varieties into early, middle and late groups. Additionally, the accuracy of the IA(DAS) was improved (RMSE = 3.69 days and MAE = 3.09 days) by using three different relative thresholds (i.e., RT50, RT55, RT60) for the three flowering groups compared to when using a single threshold (RT50). In addition, it was found that the IA(DAS) of the same soybean varieties varied greatly when planted in two different climatic regions due to the genotype-environment interactions. Overall, this study demonstrated that the IA(DAS) of soybean varieties can be identified efficiently and accurately based on UAV remote sensing multispectral time-series data. ", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Investigating the Impact of Drone Transport on the Stability of Monoclonal Antibodies for Inter-Hospital Transportation Abstract: In the field of healthcare logistics, the reliance on conventional transport methods such as cars for the delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is susceptible to challenges posed by traffic and infrastructure, leading to increased and unpredictable transport times. Recognizing the potential role of drones in mitigating these challenges, we aimed to investigate the impact of medical drone transport on the stability of mAbs. Compromised stability could lead to aggregation and immunogenicity, thereby jeopardizing the efficacy and safety of mAbs. We studied the transportation of vials as well as ready-to-administer infusion bags with blinatumomab, tocilizumab, and daratumumab. The methodology involved the measurement of both temperature and mechanical shock during drone transport. Moreover, the analytical techniques High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Light Obscuration (LO), Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI), and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) were employed to comprehensively assess the presence of aggregates and particle formation. The key findings revealed no significant differences between car and drone transport, indicating that the stability of mAbs in both vials and infusion bags was adequately maintained during drone transport. This suggests that medical drones are a viable and reliable means for the inter-hospital transport of mAbs, paving the way for more efficient and predictable logistics in healthcare delivery.

In a few years, these applications will be fully integrated into our lives. The practical application and use of UAVs presents several problems that are of a different nature to the specific technology of the components involved. Among them, the most relevant problem deriving from the use of UAVs in logistics distribution tasks is the so-called \"last mile\" delivery. In the present work, we focus on the resolution of the truck-drone team logistics problem. The problems of tandem routing have a complex structure and have only been partially addressed in the scientific literature. The use of UAVs raises a series of restrictions and considerations that did not appear previously in routing problems; most notably, aspects such as the limited power-life of batteries used by the UAVs and the determination of rendezvous points where they are replaced by fully-charged new batteries. These difficulties have until now limited the mathematical formulation of truck-drone routing problems and their resolution to mainly small-size cases. To overcome these limitations we propose an iterated greedy heuristic based on the iterative process of destruction and reconstruction of solutions. This process is orchestrated by a global optimization scheme using a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. We test our approach in a large set of instances of different sizes taken from literature. The obtained results are quite promising, even for large-size scenarios. ", "label": "True"}

The current status of pesticide application techniques for small-scale rice farmers in Red River Delta, Vietnam aims to be clarified to control serious rice pest insects, such as Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) ( Hemiptera: Delphacidae), which live on the bottom of rice plants. Interviews with farmers revealed their preferences and practices towards pesticide application. The farmers' application technique was evaluated by investigating the droplet deposition level at different heights of rice plants (bottom, middle, and top) and the distance from the spray walking path (near, middle, and far) in a rice paddy field using water-sensitive paper (WSP). Droplet deposition on WSPs was categorized into eight ranks. Ordered logistic model analysis revealed that the droplet did not reach to the bottom of plant, while no significant differences were found among the distances from the walking path. The droplet deposition rank and the mortality of N. lugens were positively correlated. The low efficiency of the pesticide applied by farmers to control N. lugens could be one of the factors that contribute to the insecticide-resistance development of N. lugens in Vietnam.

In this paper, a high-precision finite element model of small rotor logistics UAVs on the market was built in LS-DYNA. The process to model the connection structure between a range of parts of a UAV was elucidated in detail. The bolt, damping spring and rivet & thread were respectively simulated with \"NRB + beam\", \"NRB + discrete\" and \"spot weld\". By a series of static and dynamic material tests, the constitutive parameters of main materials of UAV structure were determined. Besides, a reasonable explicit time step was set by regulating the mass scaling of local elements. To verify whether the finite element model of UAV is accurate, UAV underwent a developed full-scale crash test. As revealed from the experimentally achieved results, the trend of impact load over time in collision simulation significantly complied with the experimentally achieved results, and the discrepancy between the maximum impact load peak and the experimentally achieved results only took up 6.54%. Moreover, the vital damaged parts, damaging process and failure mode of the UAV structure in the crash test were accurately characterized in the collision simulation. Thus, the UAV modeling and collision simulation was verified to exhibit feasibility.

{"text": "Title: Daytime polysomnography to perform titration for upper airway stimulation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea Abstract: Purpose Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is an innovative treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). UAS titrations are performed 3 months after activation of the device to optimize its effectiveness. In general, these titrations are performed during an in-laboratory overnight polysomnography (PSG). However, overnight titrations are expensive and can be logistically challenging because they are labor-intensive which causes shortage of sleep technicians available for night shifts. In addition, recently, overnight PSGs were postponed and canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a daytime PSG to perform titration of UAS therapy as an alternative for a conventional overnight PSG. Methods We performed a prospective single-center observational cohort study. Patients were included when planned for UAS titration; this was approximately 6 months after UAS activation. Data on sleep architecture, patient experience, and respiratory outcomes were collected to evaluate the feasibility. An overnight follow-up PSG 12 months after implantation was used to compare sleep architecture and therapy response. Results Of 23 patients, four were excluded from analysis because of technical issues during PSG. Even though patients slept significantly shorter during the daytime PSG, this was enough time to complete the titration successfully with 30-min sleep in final therapeutic settings in 84% of the patients. Patients (94%) had a positive experience with the daytime titration. Respiratory outcomes were significantly reduced during titration and were maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Daytime titrations are a valuable alternative for conventional overnight titrations. Our findings suggest the implementation of daytime titrations as standard of care. This will contribute to easier logistics and better work circumstances for sleep technicians without jeopardizing titration quality. ", "label": "False"}

This algorithm generates a global trajectory for safe aerial delivery; this trajectory enables an MAV to avoid static obstacles marked in the navigation map and satisfies the MAV's initial and arrival velocities. The MAV's trajectory is replanned by exploiting dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) and a time adjustment algorithm to enable computationally efficient unknown obstacle avoidance in local path planning. To validate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, we compare simulation results with those obtained using an existing approach based on DMPs. Furthermore, an autonomous flight is demonstrated in an outdoor environment using a custom-made MAV driven by the proposed approach.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Integrating Big Data Practices in Agriculture Abstract: Valved pulse-jet (PJ) engines have been introduced with the idea of using the elastic properties of air to generate power pulses. They are organized and developed from homes, laboratory workshops, researched at university and companies with a view to find these suitable for unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and power model aircraft. The presently available PJ engines are cheap to manufacture, but they consume an enormous amount of fuel running as they do on aqueous fuels like petrol, which is not only costly but also increases air pollution harmful to the environment. To improve the performance without wholly redesigning the engine environmentally friendly fuels such as Biofuels like ethanol could be investigated and employed. Various fuel blends are prepared using 10%, 20%, and 30% of ethanol and propane gas mixed with petrol. Performance parameters such as Specific Fuel Consumption, Fuel Flow rate, axial thrust, Exhaust temperature, and combustion temperature are studied for a number of runs. Performance characteristics of each fuel blend were gathered using various measuring devices through experimental trials. An experimental test rig was constructed to accept an ethanol blend using a liquid fuel delivery. The 10% blended fuel decreased the pollution as well as making fuel cheaper by providing low consumption rate and complete combustion with low exhaust temperature. Hence, biofuels act as alternate or blended fuels.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Mobility and Location-Aware Stable Clustering Scheme for UAV Networks Abstract: Nowadays there is a growing research interest on the possibility of enriching small flying robots with autonomous sensing and online navigation capabilities. This will enable a large number of applications spanning from remote surveillance to logistics, smarter cities and emergency aid in hazardous environments. In this context, an emerging problem is to track unauthorized small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) hiding behind buildings or concealing in large UAV networks. In contrast with current solutions mainly based on static and on-ground radars, this paper proposes the idea of a dynamic radar network of UAVs for real-time and high-accuracy tracking of malicious targets. To this end, we describe a solution for real-time navigation of UAVs to track a dynamic target using heterogeneously sensed information. Such information is shared by the UAVs with their neighbors via multi-hops, allowing tracking the target by a local Bayesian estimator running at each agent. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information gathering point-of-view, the UAVs plan their own trajectory by minimizing the posterior covariance matrix of the target state under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints. Our results show how a dynamic network of radars attains better localization results compared to a fixed configuration and how the on-board sensor technology impacts the accuracy in tracking a target with different radar cross sections, especially in non line-of-sight (NLOS) situations.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Saltmarsh Expansion in Response to Morphodynamic Evolution: Field Observations in the Jiangsu Coast using UAV Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is attracting considerable interest in academic research, commercial, and military applications. Multi-UAV systems organized in an ad hoc fashion called a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can cooperatively and collaboratively accomplish complex missions more efficiently compared to single large UAV systems. However, the unique features of FANETs such as high mobility, low node density, and high frequency of topology changes introduce challenges to the communication design, especially routing. Thus, the routing requirements of FANETs surpass those of MANETs or VANETs. In this paper, we present UAV classification, communication and application architectures, and an exhaustive survey of the existing routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks. Furthermore, we highlight the key features, strengths and weaknesses, and different mobility models used for the performance evaluation of the existing FANET routing protocols.

However, the understandings of the the planemetric patterns are limited. In this study, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)-based observations are conducted in six saltmarsh areas along the Jiangsu coast, China. 3D point clouds, consequent DEM (digital elevation model) and colour orthomosaics are generated using the SfM (Structure from Motion) techniques. We track the variations in the locations of the saltmarsh front as well as the sizes and the distributions of patchs. The saltmarshes are distributed as a whole piece in the landside, while they turn to scattered patches to the sea. We find the locations of the saltmarsh front as a function of bed elevations and season. The area of a single patch is between 0 and 90 m(2). The number of the patches increases then decreases from landside to the seaside. For tidal flats in progradation, saltmarsh slowly expands seaward following the sediment accretion.

{"text": "Title: UAS-based High-resolution Record of the Response of a Seminatural Sandy Spit to a Severe Storm Abstract: Recently, The construction of structures on the coastal zone near estuaries, which are the supply sources of sediments, causes a variation in the waterway; this induces a change in the surrounding coasts, and the resulting coastal erosion can adversely affect the lives of the local residents. In the case of a balanced sediment flow, the quantity of the sediment deposited on the coast is equal to the quantity of the released sediment. However, an increase in either of the quantities causes an imbalance in the sediment transport; consequently, the sand is either deposited or eroded in the coastal or proximate shore regions. In this study, the changes in the shoreline and Wolcheon Beach region located on the east coast of Korea was monitored between 2010 to 2019 investigate the phenomena of coastal erosion and beach deformation. The shorelines, beach width, and beach profile were primarily monitored by employing a drone and a terrestrial LiDAR. The results showed that the sediments were transported northward in summer and southward in winter until 2010 in Wolcheon Beach; however, this seasonal sediment transport was blocked during 2011-2012 by the construction of coastal structures such as breakwaters, leading to partial coastal erosion and sedimentation. Wolcheon Beach originally had the coastal characteristics of the Korean East Coast region (2010), but the sediment transport changed due to the variations in the waterway by the construction of coastal structures, leading to a significant change in the coast ( 2011). In addition, the northern beach volume increased with respect to estuary, while the southern beach volume decreased. When the offshore breakwater was constructed, the northward sediment occurred dominantly in the shield area. In particular, the planar layout of the harbor facilities concentrated the waves, which increased the quantity of the northward sediment.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Contribution of Lightweight Revolving Laser Scanner, HiRes UAV LiDARs and Photogrammetry for Characterization of Coastal Aeolian Morphologies Abstract: Human infrastructures in barrier islands restrict the natural storm-induced overwash needed by these systems to evolve, further increasing their vulnerability in the medium and long term. For this reason, accurate overwash measurements in coastal environments subject to varying degrees of occupation are needed. In this work, two Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) flights were performed over two distinct sectors of a sandy spit located in Cadiz (SW Spain) prior and after the landfall of storm Emma. This storm was a high-energy event that lasted 153 hours,with an average significant wave height of 4 m and a storm peak of 6.81 m., and water levels (tide and surge) of up to 4 m. The images derived from the UAS flights were processed with Structure From Motion (SfM) algorithms using Pix4D software, resulting in high-resolution mosaics and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the study area. These allowed (1) the digitization of the washover deposits in both sectors before and after the storm, and (2) the computation of DEMs of Difference (DoDs), which in turn allowed the analysis of volumetric estimates of erosion/accretion triggered by the significant overwash. The results revealed a non-uniform coastal response between both sectors. The area subject to higher degree of development showed a clear restriction in the onshore delivery of sediment during overwash due to the presence of a channel and a road, the coalescence of the nine pre-existing washovers into a unique deposit of 77546 m(2), and much higher damage extents and associated recovery costs. In the natural sector, the overwash processes reactivated the three pre-existing washovers (which enlarged their areas up to 200%) with no significant damages reported. These findings serve as examples of coastal responses to future similar hydrodynamic conditions, and suggest that this spit will likely evolve following different trajectories in the long-term.", "label": "False"}

In particular, the self-interference channel gains follow the complex Gaussian distribution instead of being constant. The EE is first rigorously derived and then, the optimum flight speed is determined under the information causality constraint to maximize the EE.

{"text": "Title: DETERMINATION OF THE SURFACE COLLAPSE PROCESS PHASE CAUSED BY BLOCK CAVING MINING Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems, a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has a significant impact in enhancing road safety, traffic management efficiency, and in-vehicle infotainment features. Routing in a VANET is hampered by frequent link disconnection for non-line-of-sight communication due to roadside obstacles, high mobility, and frequent topological changes. With the help of three-dimensional movement capability, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can drastically improve the routing experience of a VANET, by increasing the line-of-sight probability, better connectivity, and efficient store-carry-forward mechanism. As a result, various routing protocols with different objectives have been reported for UAV-aided VANETs. Several surveys have been conducted based on different routing protocols for VANETs so far. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no survey exists till now that dedicatedly covers routing protocols for UAV-aided VANETs. This survey paper presents a comprehensive review on state-of-the-art routing protocols for UAV-aided VANETs. The protocols are categorized into seven groups in terms of their working mechanism and design principles. The shortcomings of the protocols are identified individually by critically analyzing them with regard to their advantages, disadvantages, application areas, and future improvements.

However, the unknown varying payloads can cause negative influences that act in forms of persistent disturbances and sudden changes, damaging flight performance especially the attitude stability seriously. Targeting the persistent disturbances, an entirely novel disturbance estimator (DE) which can estimate non-smooth disturbances in a highly accurate manner for feedback compensation is proposed in this paper. To deal with the sudden changes from prescribed references and the payloads that may induce too large overshoots and input surging, a type of predictive optimal controller, which considers tracking errors and their changing rates of a class of linear multiple-input-multiple-output systems, is developed. Simulation results show that the system enhanced by the DE has better control performance than the ones enhanced by the commonly used extended state observer or nonlinear disturbance observer. Compared with the typical control approaches, the proposed control scheme enables the quad-rotor attitude system more stable performance and more ideal inputs on both persistent disturbance and sudden change resisting during payload transportation.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Measuring Change Using Quantitative Differencing of Repeat Structure-From-Motion Photogrammetry: The Effect of Storms on Coastal Boulder Deposits Abstract: UAV Communication Networks (UAVCN) comes under the umbrella of Ad hoc Network technology. It has the critical differences with existing wireless networks, which are high mobility, high speed, dynamic updates, and changes in topology due to high movement, which creates the problem of link breakages and affects the routing performance. This problem degrades the performance of UAVCN in terms; it decreases throughput and minimizes the packet delivery ratio.

Volumetric differencing software (such as the open-source package CloudCompare) provides an efficient mechanism for quantifying change in landscapes. In this case study, we apply this methodology to coastal boulder deposits on Inishmore, Ireland. Storm waves are known to move these rocks, but boulder transportation and evolution of the deposits are not well documented. We used two disparate SfM data sets for this analysis. The first model was built from imagery captured in 2015 using a GoPro Hero 3+ camera (fisheye lens) and the second used 2017 imagery from a DJI FC300X camera (standard digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera); and we used CloudCompare to measure the differences between them. This study produced two noteworthy findings: First, volumetric differencing reveals that short-term changes in boulder deposits can be larger than expected, and that frequent monitoring can reveal not only the scale but the complexities of boulder transport in this setting. This is a valuable addition to our growing understanding of coastal boulder deposits. Second, SfM models generated by different imaging hardware can be successfully compared at sub-decimeter resolution, even when one of the camera systems has substantial lens distortion. This means that older image sets, which might not otherwise be considered of appropriate quality for co-analysis with more recent data, should not be ignored as data sources in long-term monitoring studies.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Effects of a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle on urban soundscapes perception Abstract: Drones are one of the most intensively studied technologies in logistics in recent years. They combine technological features matching current trends in transport industry and society like autonomy, flexibility, and agility. Among the various concepts for using drones in logistics, parcel delivery is one of the most popular application scenarios. Companies like Amazon test drones particularly for last-mile delivery intending to achieve both reducing total cost and increasing customer satisfaction by fast deliveries. As drones are electric vehicles, they are also often claimed to be an eco-friendly mean of transportation. In this paper an energy consumption model for drones is proposed to describe the energy demand for drone deliveries depending on environmental conditions and the flight pattern. The model is used to simulate the energy demand of a stationary parcel delivery system which serves a set customers from a depot. The energy consumed by drones is compared to the energy demand of Diesel trucks and electric trucks serving the same customers from the same depot. The results indicate that switching to a solely drone-based parcel delivery system is not worthwhile from an energetic perspective in most scenarios. A stationary drone-based parcel delivery system requires more energy than a truck-based parcel delivery system particularly in urban areas where customer density is high and truck tours are comparatively short. In rather rural settings with long distances between customers, a drone-based parcel delivery system creates an energy demand comparable to a parcel delivery system with electric trucks provided environmental conditions are moderate.", "label": "False"}

However, existing ground stations cannot provide sufficient vertical observations of PM2.5, especially at fine scales regarding space and time. This study deployed a six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with portable monitors to observe the vertical distributions of PM2.5 and meteorological parameters within 1000 m lower troposphere. By comparing with ground-based monitoring station and tethered balloon platform for PM2.5 measurements, the UAV was improved and then used to perform a field observation experiment in the Qingpu district of Shanghai, China. The UAV-based observations showed a decreasing vertical profile of PM2.5 in the experimental day, with a decrease of more than 50% at 0-1000 m height. PM2.5 had a vertical pattern that declined rapidly after 700 m in the afternoon, but the morning PM2.5 had a rapid decline from 200 to 500 m compared with other height intervals in this period. A temperature inversion at a lower height in the morning blocked newly formed PM2.5 at ground to disperse upward, and PM2.5 above the temperature inversion was composed of residuals in last night. The temperature inversion gradually climbed up in the afternoon, which was beneficial to the dispersion of near-ground PM2.5. The difference of relative humidity above and below 700 m height implies different geographical origins that were well identified and explained by a cluster analysis.

Entire bar successions are exposed in 3D, offering an opportunity to improve upon sedimentological models for coarse-grained fluvial deposits. Using unmanned aircraft, structurefrom-motion photogrammetry, and ground-penetrating radar, we offer the first comprehensive assessment of the lithofacies and stratigraphic architecture of this regionally unique fluvial conglomerate. We interpret three lithofacies associations: (1) beds of chaotic breccias lining the exhumed valley wall (colluvium), (2) < 5-m-thick units dominated by horizontal to gently inclined (2-3 degrees) beds of granule to pebble conglomerates, and (3) 10-24-m-thick units of steeply inclined (similar to 30 degrees) beds of bouldery conglomerates, which dominate the channel fill. The deposit comprises at least four stories, but its thickest part is a deep scour filled by a single story of steeply inclined bouldery deposits. The direction of accretion of the giant bars was toward the paleovalley wall, where contemporaneous valley-side colluvium and bar deposits arc juxtaposed. We propose that increased discharge in a high-order trunk stream rapidly eroded the friable sandstone of the underlying Monroe Creek-Harrison formations, amassing resistant, large concretions that were subject to valley-slope mass movements and fluvial transport (subaqueous traction, grainflow, and debris flow). Giant accretion surfaces formed as fluvial bars migrated over the edges of deep scours.

{"text": "Title: Cluster-Based Control Plane Messages Management in Software-Defined Flying Ad-Hoc Network Abstract: We develop a method to learn a bio-inspired motion control policy using data collected from hawkmoths navigating in a virtual forest. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is introduced to model the dynamics of moths and sparse logistic regression is used to learn control policy parameters from the data. The results show that moths do not favor detailed obstacle location information in navigation, but rely heavily on optical flow. Using the policy learned from the moth data as a starting point, we propose an actor-critic learning algorithm to refine policy parameters and obtain a policy that can be used by an autonomous aerial vehicle operating in a cluttered environment. Compared with the moths' policy, the policy we obtain integrates both obstacle location and optical flow. We compare the performance of these two policies in terms of their ability to navigate in artificial forest areas. While the optimized policy can adjust its parameters to outperform the moth's policy in each different terrain, the moth's policy exhibits a high level of robustness across terrains. Author summary Many animals exhibit a remarkable ability to navigate in complex forest terrains. Can we learn their navigation strategy from observed flying trajectories? Further, can we refine these strategies to design UAV/drone navigation policies in dense cluttered terrains? To that end, we propose a method to analyze data from hawkmoth flight trajectories in a closed-loop virtual forest and extract the navigation control policy. We find that moths rely heavily on optical flow rather than detailed information on the location of obstacles around them.

In order to estimate the end of season biomass and yield, a random forest machine learning approach was implemented using UAV-imagery-derived predictors as input variables. Shape features derived from the UAV, such as plant area, border length, width, and length, were found to have the highest importance in the predictions, followed by vegetation indices and the entropy texture measure. The multispectral UAV imagery collected 2 weeks prior to harvest produced the highest explained variances for fresh shoot mass (87.95%), fruit numbers (63.88%), and yield mass per plant (66.51%). The RGB UAV imagery produced very similar results to those of the multispectral UAV dataset, with the explained variance reducing as a function of increasing time to harvest. The results showed that predicting the yield of salt-stressed plants produced higher accuracies when the models excluded control plants, whereas predicting the yield of control plants was not affected by the inclusion of salt-stressed plants within the models. This research demonstrates that it is possible to predict the average biomass and yield up to 8 weeks prior to harvest within 4.23% of field-based measurements and up to 4 weeks prior to harvest at the individual plant level. Results from this work may be useful in providing guidance for yield forecasting of healthy and salt-stressed tomato plants, which in turn may inform growing practices, logistical planning, and sales operations.", "label": "False"}

In this paper, air-to-ground (AG) channel measurements are carried out at some candidate frequencies, i.e., 1 GHz, 4 GHz, 12 GHz, and 24 GHz. With measurement data, the crucial channel parameters are comprehensively analyzed. Firstly, based on the channel model in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the essential coefficients for modeling path loss, including path loss exponents (PLEs) and height-dependent factors, are obtained for AG channels. Then, a novel autocorrelation model for shadow fading is proposed. Besides, the small-scale fading is statistically analyzed, where the log-logistic distribution is found as the best fit among popular distributions. Moreover, the second-order statistical characteristics, including the level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD), are extracted to describe in-depth the fading behavior.

Model based on Lyapunov present great solutions. However, setting reasonable parameters for the model is usually based on experience. Moreover, UAVs controlled by the models usually converge to destinations slowly. Heuristic planning algorithms are also mainstream approaches to guide UAVs. However, they hardly consider kinetics of UAVs. This paper proposes distributed velocity-aware algorithm and collision avoidance algorithm to serve motion planning of multiple UAVs. The velocity-aware algorithm generates paths with acceleration vectors that converge to the predefined destinations. The collision avoidance algorithm will be triggered to protect UAVs from collisions when path conflicts are predicted. Compared with hierarchical control model and Lyapunov-like control laws, our approach could improve success possibility of mission achievement for UAVs. At the same time, the algorithms help UAVs take shorter paths and less time to move to destinations safely. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": "False"}

For this purpose, a model bridge was developed to simulate movements of the key components of a highway bridge. Three types of structural movements in bridges have been studied: translation, rotation, and settlement.

Notably, logistic companies have given close attention to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck, proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery routes of truck and drone.

{"text": "Title: On-flight intercomparison of three miniature aerosol absorption sensors using unmanned aerial systems (UASs) Abstract: In the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), it is assumed that each worker moves using an individually assigned vehicle. Removing this core hypothesis opens the door for a brand new set of solutions, where workers are seen as transportable resources that can also move without the help of a vehicle. In this context, motivated by a major European energy provider, we consider a situation where workers can either walk or drive to reach a job and where carpooling is enabled. In order to quantify the potential benefits offered by this new framework, a dedicated Variable Neighborhood Search is proposed to efficiently tackle the underlying synchronization and precedence constraints that arise in this extension of the VRP. Considering a set of instances in an urban context, extensive computational experiments show that, despite conservative scenarios favoring car mobility, significant savings are achieved when compared to the solutions currently obtained by the involved company.

This single distribution channel cannot prioritize services for consumers closer to the distribution center, resulting in a waste of distribution resources. To deal with the last-kilometer delivery problem, this paper attempts to build a dual-channel distribution system consisting of UAVs and couriers. And the impact of the market allocation proportion on the expected profit of the last mile service through the two different distribution channels is discussed and analyzed. It is proved that the improved revenue sharing contract can realize the coordination of the dual-channel distribution between UAVs and the couriers. The numerical examples verify the effectiveness of the model and contract coordination. According to the research, first, with the increase in the uncertainties of the delivery quantity, the profit of the UAV channel shows a downward trend, while the profit of the courier channel remains basically the same. This is because the labor cost of the courier channel is relatively stable. Second, with the increase in the market allocation proportion of the last-kilometer delivery, the optimal delivery quantity of the UAV channel and the optimal order quantity of the courier channel are both increasing, while the overall profit of the last-kilometer is first rising and then decreasing.

We formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model of an inventory routing problem (IRP) with vehicle loss and direct delivery, which we label the military IRP (MILIRP). The objective of the MILIRP is to determine CUAV dispatching and routing policies for the resupply of geographically dispersed units operating in an austere, combat environment. The large size of the problem instance motivating this research renders dynamic programming algorithms inappropriate, so we utilize approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods to attain improved policies (relative to a benchmark policy) via an approximate policy iteration algorithmic strategy utilizing least squares temporal differencing for policy evaluation. We examine a representative problem instance motivated by resupply operations experienced by the United States Army in Afghanistan both to demonstrate the applicability of our MDP model and to examine the efficacy of our proposed ADP solution methodology. A designed computational experiment enables the examination of selected problem features and algorithmic features vis-a-vis the quality of solutions attained by our ADP policies. Results indicate that a 4-crew, 8-CUAV unit is able to resupply 57% of the demand from an 800-person organization over a 3-month time horizon when using the ADP policy, a notable improvement over the 18% attained using a benchmark policy.

As a key issue in industrial environment perception, the accurate robot localization can enhance their autonomous ability and is an important branch of robotic studies in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new method for cooperative autonomous localization among air-ground robots in a wide-ranging outdoor industrial environment. The aerial robot first maps an area of interest and achieves self-localization. Then the aerial robot transfers a simplified orthogonal perspective 2.5-D map to the ground robots for collaboration. Within the collaboration, the ground robot achieves pose estimation with respect to the unmanned aerial vehicle pose by instantaneously registering a single panorama with respect to the 2.5-D map. The 2.5-D map is used as the spatial association among air-ground robots. The ground robots estimate the orientation using automatically detected geometric information and generates the translation by aligning the 2.5-D map with a semantic segmentation of the panorama.

A drone is a sensing platform with strong environmental adaptability and expandability, which is widely used in aerial photography, transmission line inspection, remote sensing mapping, auxiliary communication, traffic patrolling, and other fields. A drone is an effective supplement to the current patrolling business in road traffic patrolling with complex urban buildings and road conditions and a limited ground perspective. However, the limited endurance of patrol drones can be directly solved by vehicles that cooperate with drones on patrolling missions. In this paper, we first proposed and studied the traffic patrolling routing problem with drones (TPRP-D) in an urban road system.

To reduce handover signaling overhead, the ground BSs take charge of control signaling delivery whereas the UAVs are in charge of payload data transmission so that users need to be simultaneously associated with a ground BS and a UAV in this network with a control-data plane-split architecture. We first propose a three-dimensional (3D) location distribution model of the UAVs using stochastic geometry which is able to generally characterize the positions of the UAVs in the sky. Using this 3D distribution model of UAVs, two performance metrics, i.e., multi-cell coverage probability and volume spectral efficiency, are proposed. Their explicit low-complexity expressions are derived and their upper limits are found when each of the UAVs and ground BSs is equipped with a massive antenna array.

Compared to traditional methods of forests monitoring which mostly use orthophotography from satellites or aircraft, there is very little research on the use of 3D canopy structure to monitor forest growth. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial could be a novel and feasible platform to generate more timely and high resolution forest 3D canopy images. In spring, the forest is supposed to experience rapid growth. In this research, we used a small UAV to monitor campus forest growth in spring at 2-day intervals. Each time, 140 images were acquired and the ground surface dense point cloud was reconstructed at high precision. Excess Green indexes (ExG) was used to extract the green canopy points. The segmented point cloud was triangulated using the greedy projection triangulation method into a mesh and its area was calculated. Forest canopy growth was analyzed at three levels: forest level, selected group level and individual tree level. A logistic curve was used to fit the time series canopy growth. Strong correlation was found R-2 = 0.8517 at forest level, R-2 = 0.9652 at selected group level and R-2 = 0.9606 at individual tree level. Moreover, high correlation was found between canopies.

In the proposed solution, a UAV equipped with a low-cost camera is able to detect ArUco markers sized 56 x 56 cm from an altitude of up to 30 m. Once the marker is detected, the UAV changes its flight behavior in order to land on the exact position where the marker is located. The proposal was evaluated and validated using both the ArduSim simulation platform and real UAV flights.

Such applications generally involve carrying bulky payloads under the vehicle. Understanding the aerodynamic interaction effects of payloads on the vehicle is the key to design such systems, in the low Reynolds number regime of small UAVs. High-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV), force, and torque measurements have been used with a rotor and a cubic box to investigate the rotor-box interactions and configurations typical of multirotor UAVs. The observed rotor and vehicle performance trends are explained by the mean flow field captured through PIV. Conditions similar to ground-effect operation are developed for the rotor at a high level of rotor-box overlap. A slight improvement in the vehicle performance is observed at conditions where the box is just out of the rotor wake. Some basic instantaneous flow phenomena due to rotor-box interaction have been identified. The interactions have been classified into three distinct modes based on observations at a range of box positions relative to the rotor. An empirical tip vortex trajectory model for isolated rotors is found to be instrumental in predicting the interaction mode at a given box position.", "label": "False"}

This paper describes an autonomous docking mechanism comprising a static ring and actuated legs, coupled with an infrared tracking device for closed-loop docking maneuvers. The dock's unique mechanical design enables precise passive positioning such that the air vehicle slides into a precise location and orientation in the dock from a wide range of entry conditions.

{"text": "Title: An online state of charge estimation for Lithium-ion and supercapacitor in hybrid electric drive vehicle Abstract: Owing to easy deployment to extend network coverage, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay network systems have been widely studied. Most UAVs are equipped with wireless local area network (WLAN) and use carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. However, the network performance of CSMA/CA is largely degraded in UAV-relay network systems (URNSs), owing to collisions caused by contention at each hop. Thus, improving network performance is important. Moreover, there are additional requirements: designing a lightweight UAV relay and avoiding unnecessary relays. In this paper, URNS architecture and time-mirroring CSMA/CA (TM-CSMA/CA) are proposed to satisfy these requirements. First, a URNS architecture is designed to support the lightweight relay, performed without a media access control (MAC) layer, and to avoid unnecessary relays at the UAV by only using the physical layer. Second, TM-CSMA/CA guarantees that the UAV relay always wins contention by adjusting the defer time without a MAC layer. Thus, TM-CSMA/CA provides better network performance than CSMA/CA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no mathematical model for analyzing end-to-end delay of CSMA/CA. Thus, we construct mathematical models to analyze both saturation throughput and delay of two-hop delivery of CSMA/CA and TM-CSMA/CA. The numerical results show that TM-CSMA/CA provides higher saturation throughput and lower end-to-end delay than CSMA/CA.", "label": "False"}

Bioaerosols, or aerosols derived from biological sources, may be a significant component of the aerosol load vectored in wildland fire smoke. If bioaerosols are injected into the upper troposphere via high-intensity wildland fires and transported across continents, there may be consequences for the ecosystems they reach. Such transport would also alter the concept of a wildfire's perimeter and the disturbance domain of its impact. Recent research has revealed that viable microorganisms are directly aerosolized during biomass combustion, but sampling systems and methodology for quantifying this phenomenon are poorly developed. Using a series of prescribed fires in frequently burned forest ecosystems, we report the results of employing a small rotary-wing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to concurrently sample aerosolized bacteria and fungi, particulate matter, and micrometeorology in smoke plumes versus background conditions. Airborne impaction-based bioaerosol sampling indicated that microbial composition differed between background air and smoke, with seven unique organisms in smoke vs. three in background air. The air temperature was negatively correlated with the number of fungal colony-forming units detected. Our results demonstrate the utility of a UAS-based sampling platform for active sampling of viable aerosolized microbes in smoke arising from wildland fires.

The resulting routine use of underpowered designs could lead to a systematic underestimation of insecticide effects on nontarget arthropod communities. We tested the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for experimental insecticide applications at tree level to increase replication in cost-efficient way. We assessed the effects of two forestry insecticides, diflubenzuron (DFB) and tebufenozide (TBF), on the oak defoliator, Thaumetopoea processionea (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), and on nontarget, tree-living Lepidoptera. Individual trees were sprayed with either insecticide or left unsprayed, in a fully factorial design involving 60 trees. Caterpillars fallen from tree crowns were sampled as a measure of mortality, while caterpillar feeding activity was monitored by collecting frass droppings. Both DFB and TBF led to greater mortality of T. processionea and lower Lepidoptera feeding activity than control levels. TBF caused measurable mortality in nontarget groups, affecting Macrolepidoptera more strongly than Microlepidoptera, while there was no significant side effect of DFB. The high treatment efficacy against the target pest indicates that UAV technology is well-suited for the application of insecticide in forests. We detected distinct responses to different insecticides among nontarget groups and suggest there is an influence of application timing and biological traits in these differences, emphasizing the need for more ecologically orientated risk assessment. UAV-supported designs can be used to link laboratory bioassays and large-scale experiments, allowing for more comprehensive assessments of insecticide effects in forest ecosystems.", "label": "False"}

Here, we describe the regulatory characteristics of the promoters of fibroin protein-encoding genes, namely, fibroin heavy chain (fibH) and fibroin light chain (fibL), using an optimized Gal4/UAS binary system. We found that (1) UAS-linked enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was effectively activated in the PSGs of Gal4/UAS transgenic silkworms, and fluorescence was continuously detected in the PSGs after complete formation of silk glands. (2) In the PSGs of fourth- and fifth-instar larvae of transgenic silkworms driven by fibL-Gal4 (LG4) or fibH-Gal4 (HG4), EGFP mRNA was detected in only day-3 to day-6 fifth-instar larvae, while the EGFP protein could be detected at each day of both larval stages. (3) High-level expression of Gal4 and UAS-linked EGFP caused a delay in PSG degradation in Gal4/UAS transgenic silkworms. (4) At the early pupal stage, EGFP fluorescence was also detected in fat bodies of Gal4/UAS transgenic silkworms, indicating that the PSG-specific EGFP was transported into fat bodies during PSG degeneration; however, the underlying mechanism needs to be further elucidated. This study provides a modified Gal4/UAS system used for efficient tissue-specific expression of target genes in the PSGs of silkworms and provides new insights into the regulatory characteristics of the promoters of key fibroin protein-encoding genes.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: BrIM and UAS for bridge inspections and management Abstract: Rather than utilizing a sophisticated robot which is trained-and tuned-for a scenario in a specific environment perfectly, most people are interested in seeing robots operating in various conditions where they have never been trained before. In accordance with the goal of utilizing aerial robots for daily operations in real application scenarios, an aerial robot must learn from its own experience and its interactions with the environment. This paper presents an instantaneous learning-based control approach for the precise trajectory tracking of a 3D-printed aerial robot which can adapt itself to the changing working conditions. Considering the fact that model-based controllers suffer from lack of modeling, parameter variations and disturbances in their working environment, we observe that the presented learning-based control method has a compelling ability to significantly reduce the tracking error under aforementioned uncertainties throughout the operation. Three case scenarios are considered: payload mass variations on an aerial robot for a package delivery problem, ground effect when the aerial robot is hovering/flying close to the ground, and wind-gust disturbances encountered in the outdoor environment. In each case study, parameter variations are learned using nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE) method, and the estimated parameters are fed to the nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC). Thanks to learning capability of the presented framework, the aerial robot can learn from its own experience, and react promptly-unlike iterative learning control which allows the system to improve tracking accuracy from repetition to repetition-to reduce the tracking error. Additionally, the fast C++ execution of NMPC and NMHE codes facilitates a complete onboard implementation of the proposed framework on a low-cost embedded processor.", "label": "False"}

Design/methodology/approach A new framework that implements camera-based unmanned aerial systems (UASs) with computer vision algorithms to collect and process inspection data, and Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM) to store and manage all related inspection information is proposed. An illustrative case study was performed using the proposed framework to test its feasibility and efficiency.

The delivery process is currently performed by self-employed contractors (i.e. cyclists); however, in the future, it might be performed using drones, as some pilot tests are currently experimenting with this possibility. This paper outlines a scenario in which a fleet of drones, performing the deliveries, requires a network of strategically located charging stations to support the business. This paper shows how the strategic location of the charging stations affects the overall performance of the system, where the maximum time the customers are willing to wait is limited. To this end, an optimisation model addressing the trade-off between the number of stations and the coverage of the demand is presented. Although not imminent, due to technology and regulatory constraints, this scenario and the formulated model can open new perspectives in the delivery process of meals and other goods.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Identifying critical source areas using multiple methods for effective diffuse pollution mitigation Abstract: River confluences are characterized by a complex mixing zone with three-dimensional (3D) turbulent structures which have been described as both streamwise-oriented structures and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vertical-oriented structures. The latter are visible where there is a turbidity difference between the two tributaries, whereas the former are usually derived from mean velocity measurements or numerical simulations. Few field studies recorded turbulent velocity fluctuations at high frequency to investigate these structures, particularly at medium-sized confluences where logistical constraints make it difficult to use devices such as acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV). This study uses the ice cover present at the confluence of the Mitis and Neigette Rivers in Quebec (Canada) to obtain long-duration, fixed measurements along the mixing zone. The confluence is also characterized by a marked turbidity difference which allows to investigate the mixing zone dynamics from drone imagery during ice-free conditions. The aim of the study is to characterize and compare the flow structure in the mixing zone at a medium-sized (similar to 40 m) river confluence with and without an ice cover. Detailed 3D turbulent velocity measurements were taken under the ice along the mixing plane with an ADV through eight holes at around 20 positions on the vertical. For ice-free conditions, drone imagery results indicate that large (KH) coherent structures are present, occupying up to 50% of the width of the parent channel. During winter, the ice cover affects velocity profiles by moving the highest velocities towards the centre of the profiles. Large turbulent structures are visible in both the streamwise and lateral velocity components. The strong correlation between these velocity components indicates that KH vortices are the dominating coherent structures in the mixing zone. A spatio-temporal conceptual model is presented to illustrate the main differences on the 3D flow structure at the river confluence with and without the ice cover.

{"text": "Title: Collecting field data in volcanic landscapes using small UAS (sUAS)/drones Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to make groundbreaking changes in the logistics industry. Leading logistics companies have been developing and testing their usage of UAVs recently as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective option. In this paper, we investigate how much the UAV delivery service is environmentally friendly compared to the traditional ground vehicle (GV) delivery service. Since there are fuel (battery) and loadable weight restrictions in the UAV delivery, multi-hopping of UAV is necessary, which may cause a large consumption of electrical energy. We present a two-phase approach. In Phase I, a new vehicle routing model to obtain optimal delivery schedules for both UAV-alone and GV-alone delivery systems is proposed, which considers each system's restrictions, such as the max loadable weight and fuel replenishment. In Phase II, CO2 emissions are computed as a sustainability measure based on the travelling distance of the optimal route obtained from Phase I, along with various GV travel-speeds.

{"text": "Title: Autonomous 3D Exploration of Large Structures Using an UAV Equipped with a 2D LIDAR Abstract: The last several years have seen a very rapid increase in the development and availability of unmanned aerial vehicles/systems (UAV or UAS), more commonly called \"drones.\" UAS are remotely-operated aerial vehicles that can be fixed-wing planes, helicopters, or aerial systems with multiple propellers. Small versions of UAS, here called \"sUAS,\" in particular, have become so prevalent that they can be easily purchased at general retail stores. This paper seeks to review and summarize the use of sUAS in volcanic research. Given their size, low cost, and relative durability, sUAS provide a light-weight tool platform that is easy to transport to field locations; quick to set-up; and easy to launch, and control. They require very little launch and recovery space. Because of these characteristics, sUAS are useful in collecting immediate and realtime aerial data, especially in remote, inaccessible, dynamic, and/or hazardous, volcanic environments. In volcanic areas, sUAS have been used for mapping, sample collection, thermal imaging, magnetic surveys, slope stability studies, and as platforms for sensors to measure outgassing of CO2 and SO2. They are also becoming invaluable for real-time hazard assessment during and after an eruption. They are, however, limited by their flight time, which is greatly affected by wind speeds. Since they are predominately made of plastic, they are also impacted by the high thermal temperatures found in active volcanic areas, which can degrade their structure and performance. With continued technological improvement however, sUAS have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to collect field data. Because of additional natural, technological, and legal challenges related to their use, it is critical that users be aware of, and adhere to, all national and local laws associated with sUAS.

The current status of pesticide application techniques for small-scale rice farmers in Red River Delta, Vietnam aims to be clarified to control serious rice pest insects, such as Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) ( Hemiptera: Delphacidae), which live on the bottom of rice plants. Interviews with farmers revealed their preferences and practices towards pesticide application. The farmers' application technique was evaluated by investigating the droplet deposition level at different heights of rice plants (bottom, middle, and top) and the distance from the spray walking path (near, middle, and far) in a rice paddy field using water-sensitive paper (WSP). Droplet deposition on WSPs was categorized into eight ranks. Ordered logistic model analysis revealed that the droplet did not reach to the bottom of plant, while no significant differences were found among the distances from the walking path. The droplet deposition rank and the mortality of N. lugens were positively correlated. The low efficiency of the pesticide applied by farmers to control N. lugens could be one of the factors that contribute to the insecticide-resistance development of N. lugens in Vietnam.", "label": "False"}

The fertile ground for digital technology applications is logistics management, which manifests itself in the dynamic development of logistics 4.0. Increasingly, it is pointed out that digital technology has some distinct features that have fundamental implications for innovation. The aim of the present study is to determine the impact of the risk of implementing digital technologies for logistics management.

{"text": "Title: Bio-inspired clustering scheme for Internet of Drones application in industrial wireless sensor network Abstract: Boulder detachment from the seafloor and subsequent transport and accumulation along rocky coasts is a complex geomorphological process that requires a deep understanding of submarine and onshore environments. This process is especially interesting in semi-enclosed shallow basins characterized by extreme storms, but without a significant tsunami record. Moreover, the response of boulder deposits located close to the coast to severe storms remains, in terms of accurate displacement measurement, limited due to the need to acquire long-term data such as ongoing monitoring datasets and repeated field surveys. We present a multidisciplinary study that includes inland and submarine surveys carried out to monitor and accurately quantify the recent displacement of coastal boulders accumulated on the southernmost coast of the Premantura (Kamenjak) Promontory (Croatia, northern Adriatic Sea). We identified recent boulder movements using unmanned aerial vehicle digital photogrammetry (UAV-DP). Fourteen boulders were moved by the waves generated by a severe storm, named Vaia, which occurred on 29 October 2018. This storm struck Northeast Italy and the Istrian coasts with its full force. We have reproduced the storm-generated waves using unstructured wave model Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN), with a significant wave height of 6.2 m in front of the boulder deposit area. These simulated waves are considered to have a return period of 20 to 30 years. In addition to the aerial survey, an underwater photogrammetric survey was carried out in order to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of the seabed and identify the submarine landforms associated with boulder detachment. The survey highlighted that most of the holes can be considered potholes, while only one detachment shape was identified. The latter is not related to storm Vaia, but to a previous storm. Two boulders are lying on the seabed and the underwater surveys highlighted that these boulders may be beached during future storms. Thus, this is an interesting example of active erosion of the rocky coast in a geologically, geomorphologically, and oceanologically predisposed locality.", "label": "False"}

Internet of Drones, a branch of Internet of Things, is used for the communication among drones. As drones are mobile in nature, they cause frequent topological changes. This changing topology causes scalability, stability, and route selection issues in Internet of Drones.

Furthermore, for route selection we propose an optimal path selection based on the residual energy and position of drone for efficient communication. The proposed scheme shows better results as compared to other bio-inspired clustering algorithms on the basis of evaluation benchmarks such as cluster building time, network energy consumption, cluster lifetime, and probability of successful delivery. The results indicate that the proposed scheme has improved 60% and 38% with respect to ant colony optimization and grey wolf optimization, respectively, in terms of average cluster building time while average energy consumption has improved 23% and 33% when compared to the ant colony optimization and grey wolf optimization, respectively.", "label": "False"}

Air-ground integrated vehicular networks (AGIVNs) assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the advantages of wide coverage and flexible configuration, which outperform the ground-based VANET in terms of communication quality. However, the complex electromagnetic interference (EMI) severely degrades the communication performance of UAV sensors.

In this paper, we propose an anti-interference scheme, named as Mary-MCM, for UAV data links in AGIVNs based on multi-ary (M-ary) spread spectrum and multi-carrier modulation (MCM). Specifically, the Mary-MCM disperses the interference power by expanding the signal spectrum, such that the anti-interference ability of AGIVNs is enhanced. Besides, by using MCM and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, the Mary-MCM improves the spectrum utilization effectively while ensuring system performance.

Although control, navigation, and communication technologies are becoming available on individual flight units, system-level motion management for dense UAS traffic remains an open question. This paper presents a motion-planning model based on nonlinear optimization techniques to centrally coordinate paths for all vehicles traversing a shared two-dimensional (2D) space. An exact bound is derived to characterize the discrete-time separation constraints, and a set of new metrics is proposed to measure 2D traffic flow efficiency. The grand goal is to make all vehicles that come under dispatch reach their respective destinations quickly and efficiently while maintaining a safe intervehicle separation at all times. This infinite-horizon operational problem is formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex optimization model that must be solved in a progressive, receding-horizon fashion. To ensure feasibility and overcome path deadlocks attributed to local optima, a series of heuristic measures are developed. By pivoting on artfully coined intermediate feasibility, the algorithm is able to circumvent imminent deadlocks in a predictive manner and progressively construct the solution with guaranteed feasibility.

The distribution and highly saline nature of the material suggest formation by the pooling and evaporation of groundwater forced through fractures to the surface during seismic activity. These saline pockets are a surface expression of the hydrological effects of seismic activity along faults. Saline pockets with similar distribution and characteristics were also identified at three additional alluvium-covered areas, all located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. Identification and mapping of these saline pockets relies on the ability to identify the continuation of structures through overlying gravels. Regolith mapping using high-resolution drone imagery and digital elevation modelling identified geomorphic markers of faulting which aided mapping the distribution of saline pockets. Saline pockets provide a unique opportunity to sample the direct expression of transported groundwater reaching the surface from depth and provide a prime target medium for mineral exploration through transported gravels.", "label": "False"}

Abstract: With the emergence of new technologies for small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), such as lightweight sensors and high-efficiency batteries, the operation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) will expand from military use to commercial use. A promising commercial application of sUAS is package delivery because of its potential to reduce acquisition and operating costs of the last-mile delivery system, while enabling new services such as same-day delivery. Moreover, in urban areas, sUAVs can deliver packages to customers without negatively affecting street traffic. To conduct urban operations, sUAS-based delivery systems must obey regulations for sUAS operations and avoid urban obstacles. In this paper, a maximum-flight-time-constrained multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows optimization model is used to create routes for sUAS-based delivery missions. To address the actual urban environment with the optimization model, a two-layered urban flight network is built by feeding an airborne light detection and ranging sensor data into an algorithm that uses a Voronoi diagram to create collision-free paths.

Thirty-two participants on the ground were requested to judge if they could see the quadcopter on a four-point scale: 1. definitely yes, 2. probably yes, 3. probably no, and 4. definitely no. The participants also responded whether they could hear the quadcopter on the same four-point scale. Logistic regression models were established to estimate the probability of detecting the quadcopter in the air, both visually and auditory. When navigating a quadcopter flying away from the operator, the sound stimulus diminished and then disappeared earlier than that of the sight of the quadcopter. The results of the study indicated that the probability of visual detection of the quadcopter at a distance of 300 m was approximately 0.3. When adopting a 50% probability of visual detection and the \"definitely or probably yes\" criterion, the estimated distance of line-of-sight was 245 m.

One such slope-channel system is examined in Lower Jurassic prograding shelf-margin clinoforms in Bey Malec Estancia, La Jardinera area, southern Neuquen Basin, Argentina. In a 4 km wide, 300 m tall, slightly oblique- to depositional-dip section of Jurassic Los Molles Formation deepwater slope deposits, seven clinoform timelines were identified by isolated slope-channel fills with thicknesses less than 50 m. Sedimentary logs, satellite images, a digital elevation model and drone photogrammetry were used to map variations in downslope channel geometry and infill facies. The slope channels are filled with sediment density flow deposits: poorly sorted conglomeratic debrites, structureless sandy high-density turbidites and well-sorted, fine-grained, graded low-density turbidites. The debrite portion decreases downslope, whereas high- and low-density turbidites increase. A grain-size analysis reveals a broad downslope fining trend of turbidite and debrite beds within slope channels with increasing water depth, and some notable bypass of conglomeratic facies to the lowermost slope channels and basin floor fans. The architecture of the slope channels changes from lateral to aggradational infill downstream. The Bey Malec clinoforms and its slope channels add new knowledge on downslope changes for sediment delivery in relatively shallow (<500 m water depth), prograding-dominant deepwater basins.

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) carrying visible and near infrared (VNIR) sensors are a suitable nonintrusive mapping platform. UAS deployments in Antarctica are, due to weather and logistical restrictions, infrequent and short, thus it is essential that field time is optimized. This article identified the optimal spectral and spatial resolution of the UAS-based sensors to facilitate efficient data acquisition without jeopardizing the accuracy of remotely sensed moss health indicators. A hyperspectral line scanner was used to collect imagery of two moss study sites near the Casey Australian Antarctic base. The spectral and spatial data degradation simulated two lightweight sensors that could be used for more efficient spectral image acquisition in the future. These simulations revealed that the spectral quality deteriorated more definitively at the spatial resolution where moss spectra started to mix with spectra of surrounding rocks. Subsequently, random forest models (RFMs) were trained with lab measurements for predicting chlorophyll content and effective leaf density. The RFMs were applied to the UAS imagery of the reduced spectral and spatial resolutions to quantify decline in accuracy of both indicators. We identified the optimal UAS sensor capable of mapping a relatively large moss bed (similar to 5 ha) with the prediction accuracy similar to the hyperspectral system. This sensor would be a frame camera acquiring 25 VNIR spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 8 cm.

The operators objective is to maximize its long-term average revenue and stabilize the queuing system which represents the content transfer services. To model the interactions between the operator and the CPs, a novel framework is proposed that combines: first, cooperative game that enables the CPs to form coalitions in which all subscribers can exchange content via D2D links, thereby reducing content transfer costs and delays; second, Lyapunov optimization based dynamic channel and UAVs activity allocation policy of the operator. Through analytical and numerical evaluations, it is proven that if the operator and each CP are rational, the network reaches a state where all the CPs are in the stable coalitional structure, whereas, the dynamic policy of the operator is optimal with the trade-off in the total queue backlog.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Vertical Profiles of Ozone Concentration Collected by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and the Mixing of the Nighttime Boundary Layer over an Amazonian Urban Area Abstract: At present, new approaches for the use of drones in high-precision optical applications are rising, especially with those known as multirotor. However, the optical turbulence effects generated by multirotor drones are not entirely understood. These optical effects can reduce the performance of the optical instruments that they transport. We present measurements of the wavefront deformation generated by the temperature fluctuations and the airflow of a drone's propulsion system. To do so, we used a single arm of a DJI S800 EVO Hexacopter (professional drone) and measured its operating temperature with a commercial infrared camera. The resulting temperature variation, between a switched-off propulsion system at room temperature and one running at its maximum performance, was 34.2 degrees C. Later, we performed two different interferometric tests: Takeda's method and the phase-shifting technique, using a ZYGO interferometer. These tests show that the total deformation over an incident wavefront to the propeller airflow is lower than 0.074 lambda PV and 0.007 lambda RMS (HeNe laser, lambda = 633 nm). We determine that the optical turbulence produced by a drone propulsion system is negligible. (C) The Authors.

{"text": "Title: Security Modeling of Autonomous Systems: A Survey Abstract: The nighttime boundary layer was studied in an urban area surrounded by tropical forest by use of a copter-type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in central Amazonia during the wet season. Fifty-seven vertical profiles of ozone concentration, potential temperature, and specific humidity were collected from surface to 500 m above ground level (a.g.l.) at high vertical and temporal resolutions by use of embedded sensors on the UAV. Abrupt changes in ozone concentration with altitude served as a proxy of nighttime boundary layer (NBL) height for the case of a normal, undisturbed, stratified nighttime atmosphere, corresponding to 40% of the cases. The median height of the boundary layer was 300 m. A turbulent mixing NBL constituted 28% of the profiles, while the median height of the boundary layer was 290 m. The remaining 32% of profiles corresponded to complex atmospheres without clear boundary layer heights. The occurrence of the three different cases correlated well with relative cloud cover. The results show that the standard nighttime model widely implemented in chemical transport models holds just 40% of the time, suggesting new challenges in modeling of regional nighttime chemistry. The boundary layer heights were also somewhat higher than observed previously over forested and pasture areas in Amazonia, indicating the important effect of the urban heat island.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Targeting of copper-trafficking chaperones causes gene-specific systemic pathology in Drosophila melanogaster: prospective expansion of mutational landscapes that regulate tumor resistance to cisplatin Abstract: With a rising demand for utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deliver materials in outdoor environments, particular attention must be given to all the different aspects influencing the deployment of UAVs for such purposes. These aspects include the characteristics of the UAV fleet (e.g., size of fleet, UAV specifications and capabilities), the energy consumption (highly affected by weather conditions and payload) and the characteristics of the network and customer locations. All these aspects must be taken into account when aiming to achieve deliveries to customers in a safe and timely manner. However, at present, there is a lack of decision support tools and methods for mission planners that consider all these influencing aspects together. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a decomposed solution approach, which provides decision support for UAVs' fleet mission planning. The proposed approach assists flight mission planners in aerospace companies to select and evaluate different mission scenarios, for which flight-mission plans are obtained for a given fleet of UAVs, while guaranteeing delivery according to customer requirements in a given time horizon. Mission plans are analyzed from multiple perspectives including different weather conditions (wind speed and direction), payload capacities of UAVs, energy capacities of UAVs, fleet sizes, the number of customers visited by a UAV on a mission and delivery performance. The proposed decision support-driven declarative model supports the selection of the UAV mission planning scenarios subject to variations on all these configurations of the UAV system and variations in the weather conditions. The computer simulation based experimental results, provides evidence of the applicability and relevance of the proposed method. This ultimately contributes as a prototype of a decision support system of UAVs fleet-mission planning, able to determine whether is it possible to find a flight-mission plan for a given fleet of UAVs guaranteeing customer satisfaction under the given conditions. The mission plans are created in such a manner that they are suitable to be sent to Air Traffic Control for flight approval.", "label": "False"}

However, autopilot systems fail to navigate due to lost or jammed GNSS signal. To solve this problem, information from other sensors such as optical sensors are used. Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been developed over the last few years and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., visual SLAM algorithms achieve centimeter-level precision in an in-doors environment). Also, map matching localization approaches are used for UAV localization relatively to imagery from static maps such as Google Maps. Unfortunately, the accuracy and robustness of these algorithms are very dependent on up-to-date maps. The purpose of this research is to improve the accuracy and robustness of map-relative particle filter-based localization using a downward-facing optical camera mounted on an autonomous aircraft. This research shows how image similarity to likelihood conversion function impacts the results of particle filter localization algorithm. Two parametric image similarity to likelihood conversion functions (logistic and rectifying) are proposed. A dataset of simulated aerial imagery is used for experiments. The experiment results are shown, that the particle filter localization algorithm using the logistic function was able to surpass the accuracy of state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM2 algorithm by 2.6 times.

{"text": "Title: Postprocessing Synchronization of a Laser Scanning System Aboard a UAV Abstract: In recent years, small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have demonstrated their promising capabilities in supporting a range of applications, such as surveillance, inspection, package delivery, precision agriculture, etc. Given an increasing number of UAVs in the low-altitude airspace, connecting UAVs to form the Internet of Drones (IoDs) is a promising trend to enhance the flying safety as well as the service quality of UAVs. However, due to the open-access communication environment, IoD also raises security and privacy concerns, including authentication threat as well as the leakage of identity, location, and flying routes. In order to address the security and privacy concerns in IoD, this paper proposes an efficient privacy-preserving authentication framework. By utilizing the lightweight online/offline signature design, our framework assures the authentication efficiency when deploying on resource-constrained small-scale UAVs. Considering the high mobility of UAVs, a predictive authentication approach is investigated with mobile edge computing (MEC) in our framework to further reduce the authentication cost for potential authentication activities. Meanwhile, by designing a buffer pseudonym and public key update strategy, our framework enables the protection of privacy in terms of UAVs' identity, location, and flying routes.

{"text": "Title: Localization and Clustering Based on Swarm Intelligence in UAV Networks for Emergency Communications Abstract: Synchronization of airborne laser scanning devices is a critical process that directly affects data accuracy. This process can be more challenging with low-cost airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems because some device connections from off-the-shelf sensors are less stable. An alternative to synchronization is performing a postprocessing clock correction. This article presents a technique for postprocessing synchronization (off-line) that estimates clock differences based on the correlation between the signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) trajectory and the light detection and ranging (lidar) range, followed by refinement with a least-squares method. The correlation between signals was automatically estimated considering the planned flight maneuvers, in a flat terrain, to produce altimetric trajectory variations. Experiments were performed with an Ibeo LUX laser unit integrated with a No-vAtel SPAN-IGM-S1 inertial navigation system that was transported by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

{"text": "Title: Neural-Blockchain-Based Ultrareliable Caching for Edge-Enabled UAV Networks Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligencebased localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligencebased clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Return flows from beaver ponds enhance floodplain-to-river metals exchange in alluvial mountain catchments Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) reduces the computational distance between the source and the servers by fortifying near-user site evaluations of data for expedited communications, using caching. Caching provides ephemeral storage of data on designated servers for low-latency transmissions. However, with the network following a hierarchical layout, even the near-user site evaluations can be impacted by the overheads associated with maintaining a perpetual connection and other factors (e.g., those relating to the reliability of the underpinning network). Prior solutions study reliability as a factor of throughput, delays, jitters, or delivery ratio. However, with modern networks supporting high data rates, a current research trend is in ultrareliability. The latter is defined in terms of availability, connectivity, and survivability. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the ultrareliable communication in MEC. Specifically, in our setting, we use drones as on-demand nodes for efficient caching. While some existing solutions use cache-enabled drones, they generally focus only on the positioning problem rather than factors relating to ultrareliable communications. We present a novel neural-blockchain-based drone-caching approach, designed to ensure ultrareliability and provide a flat architecture (via blockchain). This neural-model fortifies an efficient transport mechanism, since blockchain maintains high reliability amongst the peers involved in the communications. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed approach scores well in the following metrics: the probability of connectivity reaches 0.99; energy consumption is decreased by 60.34%; the maximum failure rate is affected by 13.0%; survivability is greater than 0.90; reliability reaches 1.0 even for a large set of users.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Intermediate-scale horizontal isoprene concentrations in the near-canopy forest atmosphere and implications for emission heterogeneity Abstract: River to floodplain hydrologic connectivity is strongly enhanced by beaver- (Castor canadensis) engineered channel water diversions. The hydroecological impacts are wide ranging and generally positive, however, the hydrogeochemical characteristics of beaver-induced flowpaths have not been thoroughly examined. Using a suite of complementary ground- and drone-based heat tracing and remote sensing methodology we characterized the physical template of beaver-induced floodplain exchange for two alluvial mountain streams near Crested Butte, Colorado, USA. A flowpath-oriented perspective to water quality sampling allowed characterization of the chemical evolution of channel water diverted through floodplain beaver ponds and ultimately back to the channel in 'beaver pond return flows'. Subsurface return flow seepages were universally suboxic, while ponds and surface return flows showed a range of oxygen concentration due to in-situ photosynthesis and atmospheric mixing. Median concentrations of reduced metals: manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and arsenic (As) were substantially higher along beaver-induced flowpaths than in geologically controlled seepages and upstream main channel locations. The areal footprint of reduced return seepage flowpaths were imaged with surface electromagnetic methods, indicating extensive zones of high-conductivity shallow groundwater flowing back toward the main channels and emerging at relatively warm bank seepage zones observed with infrared. Multiple-depth redox dynamics within one focused seepage zone showed coupled variation over time, likely driven by observed changes in seepage rate that may be controlled by pond stage. High-resolution times series of dissolved Mn and Fe collected downstream of the beaver-impacted reaches demonstrated seasonal dynamics in mixed river metal concentrations. Al time series concentrations showed proportional change to Fe at the smaller stream location, indicating chemically reduced flowpaths were sourcing Al to the channel. Overall our results indicated beaver-induced floodplain exchanges create important, and perhaps dominant, transport pathways for floodplain metals by expanding chemically-reduced zones paired with strong advective exchange.

{"text": "Title: Does Insurance Status Impact Delivery of Care with Upper Airway Stimulation for OSA? Abstract: The emissions, deposition, and chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are thought to be influenced by underlying landscape heterogeneity at intermediate horizontal scales of several hundred meters across different forest subtypes within a tropical forest. Quantitative observations and scientific understanding at these scales, however, remain lacking, in large part due to a historical absence of canopy access and suitable observational approaches. Herein, horizontal heterogeneity in VOC concentrations in the near-canopy atmosphere was examined by sampling from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flown horizontally several hundred meters over the plateau and slope forests in central Amazonia during the morning and early afternoon periods of the wet season of 2018. Unlike terpene concentrations, the isoprene concentrations in the near-canopy atmosphere over the plateau forest were 60% greater than those over the slope forest. A gradient transport model constrained by the data suggests that isoprene emissions differed by 220 to 330% from these forest subtypes, which is in contrast to a 0% difference implemented in most present-day biosphere emissions models (i.e., homogeneous emissions). Quantifying VOC concentrations, emissions, and other processes at intermediate horizontal scales is essential for understanding the ecological and Earth system roles of VOCs and representing them in climate and air quality models.", "label": "False"}

Although it is assumed that most marine plastics are transported from land to the ocean through rivers, only limited data on riverine plastic transport exists.

However, the implementation of UAV-based crack assessment for real bridge piers is hindered by several key issues, including the following: (a) both perspective distortion and the geometry distortion by nonflat structural surfaces usually appear on crack images taken by the UAV system from the pier surface; however, these two kinds of distortions are difficult to correct at the same time; and (b) the crack image taken by a close-range inspection flight UAV system is partially imaged, containing only a small part of the entire surface of the pier, and thereby hinders crack localization.

{"text": "Title: Evaluation of Scintillator Detection Materials for Application within Airborne Environmental Radiation Monitoring Abstract: Tectonic and geomorphic processes drive landscape evolution over different spatial and temporal scales. In mountainous environments, river incision sets the pace of landscape evolution, and hillslopes respond to channel incision by, e.g., gully retreat, bank erosion, and landslides. Sediment produced during stochastic landslide events leads to mobilization of soil and regolith on the slopes that can later be transported by gravity and water to the river network during phases of hillslope-channel geomorphic coupling. The mechanisms and scales of sediment connectivity mitigate the propagation of sediment pulses throughout the landscape and eventually drive the contribution of landslides to the overall sediment budget of mountainous catchments. However, to constrain the timing of the sediment cascade, the inherent stochastic nature of sediment and transport through landsliding requires an integrated approach accounting for different space scales and timescales. In this paper, we examine the sediment production on hillslopes and evacuation to the river network of one landslide, i.e. the Schimbrig earthflow, affecting the Entle River catchment located in the foothills of the Central Swiss Alps. We quantified sediment fluxes over annual, decadal, and millennial timescales using respectively unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-structurefrom-motion (SfM) techniques, classic photogrammetry, and in situ produced cosmogenic radionuclides. At the decadal scale, sediment fluxes quantified for the period 1962-1998 are highly variable and are not directly linked to the intensity of sediment redistribution on the hillslope. At the millennial scale, landslide occurrence perturbs the regional positive linear relationship between sediment fluxes and downstream distance as the landslide-affected Schimbrig catchment is characterized by a decrease in sediment fluxes and a strong variability. Importantly, the average decadal sediment flux of the Schimbrig catchment is 2 orders of magnitude higher than millennial sediment fluxes computed over the same spatial extent. The discrepancy between decadal and millennial sediment fluxes, combined to the highly variable annual sediment evacuation from the hillslopes to the channel network suggest that phases of hillslope-channel geomorphic coupling are short and intermittent. During most of the time, the first-order catchments are transport-limited and sediment dynamics in the headwaters are uncoupled from the fluvial systems. In addition, our unique spatio-temporal database of sediment fluxes highlights the transient character of the intense geomorphic activity of the Schimbrig catchment in a regional context. Its decadal sediment flux is of the same order of magnitude as the background sediment flux going out of the entire Entle River catchment. Over the last 50 years, the Schimbrig catchment, which represents ca. 1 % of the entire study area, provides 65 % of the sediments that the entire Entle catchment will supply over the millennial scale. These results suggest that episodic supply of sediment from landslides during intermittent phases of hillslope-channel geomorphic coupling are averaged out when considering sediment fluxes at longer timescales and larger spatial scales.", "label": "False"}

Abstract: Networked operation of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) demands fusion of information from disparate sources for accurate flight control. In this investigation, a novel sensor fusion architecture for detecting aircraft runway and horizons as well as enhancing the awareness of surrounding terrain is introduced based on fusion of enhanced vision system (EVS) and synthetic vision system (SVS) images. EVS and SVS image fusion has yet to be implemented in real-world situations due to signal misalignment. We address this through a registration step to align EVS and SVS images. Four fusion rules combining discrete wavelet transform (DWT) sub-bands are formulated, implemented, and evaluated. The resulting procedure is tested on real EVS-SVS image pairs and pairs containing simulated turbulence. Evaluations reveal that runways and horizons can be detected accurately even in poor visibility. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that different aspects of EVS and SVS images can be emphasized by using different DWT fusion rules. The procedure is autonomous throughout landing, irrespective of weather. The fusion architecture developed in this study holds promise for incorporation into manned heads-up displays (HUDs) and UAV remote displays to assist pilots landing aircraft in poor lighting and varying weather.

This motivates the study presented in this paper, which aims at investigating the capability of external elements that are independent of the vehicular traffic flow and its inherent limitations (e.g., airborne unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a.k.a., drones) to serve as possible adjuvant relays; thus, contributing to strengthening/healing weak/broken communication links among ground-bound vehicular entities (i.e., RoadSide Units (RSUs) and vehicles) and uplifting the vehicular connectivity and delay performance. Particularly, in the context of a vehicular sub-networking scenario, a UAV mobility model is proposed as a first step in analytically capturing macroscopic dynamics for UAVs exhibiting way point mobility patterns and plying over a considered roadway segment. Then, a stochastic analytical model is formulated for the purpose of mathematically characterizing the path availability and achieved data delivery delays in the presence of these UAVs. A simulation framework is established to verify the validity and accuracy of the proposed models and gauge the merit of UAV assistance in improving the vehicular connectivity and data delivery delay performance.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Drone Based Quantification of Channel Response to an Extreme Flood for a Piedmont Stream Abstract: Plastic debris has become an abundant pollutant in marine, coastal and riverine environments, posing a large threat to aquatic life. Effective measures to mitigate and prevent marine plastic pollution require a thorough understanding of its origin and eventual fate. Several models have estimated that land-based sources are the main source of marine plastic pollution, although field data to substantiate these estimates remain limited. Current methodologies to measure riverine plastic transport require the availability of infrastructure and accessible riverbanks, but, to obtain measurements on a higher spatial and temporal scale, new monitoring methods are required. This paper presents a new methodology for quantifying riverine plastic debris using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including a first application on Klang River, Malaysia. Additional plastic measurements were done in parallel with the UAV-based approach to make comparisons between the two methods. The spatiotemporal distribution of the plastics obtained with both methods show similar patterns and variations. With this, we show that UAV-based monitoring methods are a promising alternative for currently available approaches for monitoring riverine plastic transport, especially in remote and inaccessible areas.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Mechanism of a low-angle translational block slide: evidence from the September 2018 Naga landslide, Philippines Abstract: The influence of extreme floods on the form and functioning of upland systems has concentrated on the erosive impact of these flows. They are seen to be highly competent with coarse sediment transport rates limited by upstream supply and moderated by the blanketing' effect of an armour layer. This study investigates the effect of extreme events on the upland sediment cascade subjected to a recent extreme rainfall-induced flood event. The drone-based survey generated orthophotography and a DEM surface, which was compared with historic LiDAR data. This allowed erosion and deposition to be quantified and the surface micro-variation used to characterise stable and mobile sediment. The idealised model of sediment residence time increasing downstream is questioned by the findings of this study as relatively little coarse bedload sediment appears to have been transferred downstream in favour of initial local channel erosion (moderated by legacy large sediment), mid-reach palaeo-channel reactivation, sub-channel infilling and downstream deposition of the majority of mobilised sediment across berm and bar surfaces within the active inset channel margins. Channel margin erosion was largely limited to fine sediment stripping moderated by the re-exposure of post-glacial sediment. Only a weak relationship was found between local channel slope and deposition, with storage linked more to the presence of inset berm and bar areas within the inset active channel. Downstream fining of sediment is apparent as is a strong contrast between coarser active sub-channels and finer bar and berm areas.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Survey on Communication and Networks for Autonomous Marine Systems Abstract: This study tests the impact of drone transportation on the quality of a medicine. Modelling the critical process parameters of drone flight, the effects of temperature and vibration on insulin were investigated using the pharmacopoeia methods. The medicine, Actrapid, (3.5 mg/mL of insulin), was flown by a quad-rotor drone. Insulin stored between -20 and 40 degrees C for 30 mins, and subjected to vibration (0-40 Hz, 25 degrees C, 30 mins) passed the pharmacopeia tests. Dynamic light scattering identified the active tetrameric and hexameric forms of insulin post testing. Vibration frequencies during drone flight were between 0.1 and 3.4 Hz. There was no evidence of visible insulin aggregates following the drone transportation. The differences in UV absorbance readings between flown Actrapid and controls were insignificant (p = 0.89). No adverse impact of drone transport on insulin was observed. This study provides supporting evidence that drone transportation of medicinal products containing insulin is feasible. The authors recommend that when considering the drone delivery of medicines five tests need to be applied. These tests must determine the safe flight time and range, the quality of the medicine post flight, the onboard conditions experienced by the medicine, the security of the drone supply chain and the effect of drone failure on both the medicine and the environment.", "label": "False"}

Existing autonomous systems are becoming more powerful and utilise the capabilities of several types of devices such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) - sometimes referred as Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) -, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), moored and drifting systems and, recently emerging, autonomous vessels. Their importance in providing new services in maritime environments is undeniable and the opportunity for coordinated and interconnected operations is clear. However, continuous wide integration of various technologies in maritime environments still faces many challenges. Operations may take place in remote locations, so that dependence on third-party infrastructures such as satellite communication or terrestrial communication systems must be expected. The reliability, performance, availability, and cost of such systems are important issues that need to be tackled. This work reviews the major advancements on state-of-the-art autonomous maritime vehicles and systems, which are used in several different scenarios, from scientific research to transportation.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the VRPD that we call the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones and En Route Operations (VRPDERO). Here, in contrast to the VRPD, drones may not only be launched and retrieved at vertices but also on some discrete points that are located on each arc. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and introduce some valid inequalities that enhance the performance of the MILP solvers. Furthermore, due to limited performance of the solvers in addressing large-scale instances, we propose an algorithm based on the concepts of Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Tabu Search (TS). In order to evaluate the performance of the introduced algorithm as well as the solver in solving the VRPDERO instances, we carried out extensive computational experiments. According to the numerical results, the proposed valid inequalities and the heuristic have a significant contribution in solving the VRPDERO effectively. In addition, the consideration of en route operations can increase the utilization of drones and lead to an improved makespan. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Initiation and runout characteristics of debris flow surges in Ohya landslide scar, Japan Abstract: Much progress can be expected in the domain of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication by the next decade. The cooperation between multiple UAVs in the air exchanging data among themselves can naturally form a flying ad hoc network (FANET). Such networks can be the key support to accomplish several kinds of missions while providing the required assistance to terrestrial networks. However, they are confronted with many challenges and difficulties, which are due to the high mobility of UAVs, the frequent packet losses, and the weak links between UAVs, all affecting the reliability of the data delivery. Furthermore, the unbalanced energy consumption may result in earlier UAV failure and consequently accelerate the decrease of the network lifetime, thus disrupting the overall network. This paper supports the use of the movement information and the residual energy level of each UAV to guarantee a high level of communication stability while predicting a sudden link breakage prior to its occurrence. A robust route discovery process is used to explore routing paths where the balanced energy consumption, the link breakage prediction, and the connectivity degree of the discovered paths are all considered. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through a series of simulations. The outcomes demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of increasing the lifetime of the network, minimizing the number of path failures, and decreasing the packet losses.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: sUAS, SfM-MVS photogrammetry and a topographic algorithm method to quantify the volume of sediments retained in check-dams Abstract: The characteristics of debris flows (e.g., velocity, discharge, kinematic energy) are highly dependent on surges incurring abrupt changes to flow height, velocity, and boulder concentration. Therefore, understanding the initiation and runout characteristics of surges is essential when planning debris flow mitigation. Monitoring performed using 10 time-lapse cameras (TLCs) in Ohya landslide, central Japan, where debris flows occur frequently due to mobilization of storage (i.e., talus cone and channel deposits), allowed us to obtain data on a series of surge processes, from initiation to termination, which occurred during each debris flow event. We also analyzed temporal changes in the spatial distribution of storage in the debris flow initiation zone, associated with sediment supply from hillslopes and evacuation of sediment by the occurrence of debris flows, through periodic measurements of topography using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Debris flow surges were mainly induced by repetitive mass movement of storage through the erosion of channel deposits by overland flow, sliding of channel deposits, and sediment and water supply from channel banks and tributaries. Development of a spontaneous wave on the flow surface was not an important formation process of surges in the Ohya landslide. Many debris flow surges initiated at channel sections with deep storage (>2 m in depth), located <30 m below a junction with a tributary, when the maximum 10-min rainfall intensity exceeded 5 mm. Partly saturated flow, which has an unsaturated layer in its upper part, was the predominant flow type in the steep initiation zone, while fully saturated flow was predominant in the gentle transportation and deposition zones. Flow type often changed as the surges descended. Partly saturated flow was predominant when the volume of storage in the initiation zone was large, whereas fully saturated flow was predominant when the volume of storage was small. When we compared debris flows with similar total sediment volume, travel distance was long when fully saturated flow with high flow mobility was predominant because of the small volume of storage in the initiation zone. The volume of storage also affected flow path avulsion on the debris flow fan by controlling the flow mobility of surges. Consequently, the spatial distribution and total volume of storage are important factors controlling the initiation location, predominant flow type, and termination location of surges.

{"text": "Title: U2RV: UAV-assisted reactive routing protocol for VANETs Abstract: Lesser snow goose (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) populations have dramatically altered vegetation communities through increased foraging pressure. In remote regions, regular habitat assessments are logistically challenging and time consuming. Drones are increasingly being used by ecologists to conduct habitat assessments, but reliance on georeferenced data as ground truth may not always be feasible. We estimated goose habitat degradation using photointerpretation of drone imagery and compared estimates to those made with ground-based linear transects. In July 2016, we surveyed five study plots in La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, to evaluate the effectiveness of a fixed-wing drone with simple Red Green Blue (RGB) imagery for evaluating habitat degradation by snow geese. Ground-based land cover data was collected and grouped into barren, shrub, or non-shrub categories. We compared estimates between ground-based transects and those made from unsupervised classification of drone imagery collected at altitudes of 75, 100, and 120 m above ground level (ground sampling distances of 2.4, 3.2, and 3.8 cm respectively). We found large time savings during the data collection step of drone surveys, but these savings were ultimately lost during imagery processing. Based on photointerpretation, overall accuracy of drone imagery was generally high (88.8% to 92.0%) and Kappa coefficients were similar to previously published habitat assessments from drone imagery. Mixed model estimates indicated 75m drone imagery overestimated barren (F-2,F-182 = 100.03, P < 0.0001) and shrub classes (F-2,F-182 = 160.16, P < 0.0001) compared to ground estimates. Inconspicuous graminoid and forb species (non-shrubs) were difficult to detect from drone imagery and were underestimated compared to ground-based transects (F-2,F-182 = 843.77, P < 0.0001).

{"text": "Title: UAV Payload Transportation via RTDP Based Optimized Velocity Profiles Abstract: When it comes to keeping the data routing robust and effective in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), stable and durable connectivity constitutes the keystone to ensure successful point-to-point communication. Since VANETs can comprise all kinds of mobile vehicles moving and changing direction frequently, this may result in frequent link failures and network partitions. Moreover, when VANETs are deployed in a city environment, another problem arises, that is, the existing obstructions (eg, buildings, trees, and hoppers) preventing the line-of-sight between vehicles, thus degrading wireless transmissions. Therefore, it is more complicated to design a routing technique that adapts to frequent changes in the topology. In order to settle all these problems, in this work, we design a flooding scheme that automatically reacts at each topology variation while overcoming the present obstacles while exchanging data in ad hoc mode with drones that are commonly called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Also, the aim of this work is to explore well-regulated routing paths providing a long lifetime connectivity based on the amount of traffic and the expiration time of each discovered path. A set of experiments is carried out using a simulation, and the outcomes are confronted with similar protocols based on a couple of metrics. The results clearly show that the assistance of UAVs to vehicles is capable of providing high delivery ratios and low delivery delays while efficiently extending the network connectivity.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Early Detection of Invasive Exotic Trees Using UAV and Manned Aircraft Multispectral and LiDAR Data Abstract: This work deals with load transportation by quadrotors, when the load is attached to the vehicles through flexible cables. More specifically, two quadrotors are used to carry a single load, which is attached to both vehicles, through such kind of cables. The idea of using two quadrotors working cooperatively to carry the load is adopted to suppress any load oscillation in the direction of movement, what would happen if just one UAV were used. As a consequence of using two UAVs (or more than two) it can happen collisions between the vehicles when carrying the load, caused by the forces the load exert on the two vehicles, whose tendency is to bring the vehicles closer one to the other when they accelerate forward. The paper proposes a strategy to avoid such collisions and any collision with obstacles eventually present in the working space as well. Simulated results are shown and discussed, using two AR.Drone (R) 2.0 quadrotor to carry the load, which validate the proposed strategy. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

{"text": "Title: DYNAMIC MAPS FOR AUTOMATED DRIVING AND UAV GEOFENCING Abstract: Exotic conifers can provide significant ecosystem services, but in some environments, they have become invasive and threaten indigenous ecosystems. In New Zealand, this phenomenon is of considerable concern as the area occupied by invasive exotic trees is large and increasing rapidly. Remote sensing methods offer a potential means of identifying and monitoring land infested by these trees, enabling managers to efficiently allocate resources for their control. In this study, we sought to develop methods for remote detection of exotic invasive trees, namely Pinus sylvestris and P. ponderosa. Critically, the study aimed to detect these species prior to the onset of maturity and coning as this is important for preventing further spread. In the study environment in New Zealand's South Island, these species reach maturity and begin bearing cones at a young age. As such, detection of these smaller individuals requires specialist methods and very high-resolution remote sensing data. We examined the efficacy of classifiers developed using two machine learning algorithms with multispectral and laser scanning data collected from two platforms-manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The study focused on a localized conifer invasion originating from a multi-species pine shelter belt in a grassland environment. This environment provided a useful means of defining the detection thresholds of the methods and technologies employed. An extensive field dataset including over 17,000 trees (height range = 1 cm to 476 cm) was used as an independent validation dataset for the detection methods developed. We found that data from both platforms and using both logistic regression and random forests for classification provided highly accurate (kappa <mml:semantics><0.996</mml:semantics>) detection of invasive conifers. Our analysis showed that the data from both UAV and manned aircraft was useful for detecting trees down to 1 m in height and therefore shorter than 99.3% of the coning individuals in the study dataset. We also explored the relative contribution of both multispectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in the detection of invasive trees through fitting classification models with different combinations of predictors and found that the most useful models included data from both sensors. However, the combination of ALS and multispectral data did not significantly improve classification accuracy. We believe that this was due to the simplistic vegetation and terrain structure in the study site that resulted in uncomplicated separability of invasive conifers from other vegetation. This study provides valuable new knowledge of the efficacy of detecting invasive conifers prior to the onset of coning using high-resolution data from UAV and manned aircraft. This will be an important tool in managing the spread of these important invasive plants.", "label": "False"}

UAVs, or as known as drones, have appeared to be productive in finishing complex errands when sorted out as ad hoc connected groups, thereby bringing into existence a Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET). Owing to its specific characteristics such as high mobility, rapid topology changes, and frequent link failures, FANETs bring further challenges into these networks. Therefore, developing an efficient routing protocol over FANETs is a very challenging matter and consequently triggered the attention of a lot of current researchers. In this article, we propose a Multi Data Rate Mobility Aware (MDRMA) protocol in which novel routing and power controlled mechanisms have been suggested. Basically, MDRMA protocol is considered as a major extension of Mobility Aware Dual Phase Ad-hoc on-demand Distance Vector with Adaptive Hello Messages (MA-DP-AODV-AHM) protocol. Particularly, in MDRMA-Routing algorithm, the establishment of routes is not arbitrarily but rather is conditioned upon the achievement of certain requirements which can be extracted from the positive answers of the questions follow. Is that intermediate UAV able of affording the possible transmission rate requested by the source UAV? Are the transmitting and receiving UAVs not thrifting away from each other? Does the speed of that intermediate UAV not exceed a certain threshold? Upon the efficient deal of prior concerns, MDRMA-Routing algorithm guarantees establishing stable routes with fast data forwarding wireless links. Not only to this extent, MDRMA-Power controlled algorithm also adds some modifications on 802.11b standard, explicitly on RTS/CTS collision avoidance technique, to maintain the minimum transmission power required by a transmitting UAV for a successful reception of packets at target UAV and at a desired data transmission rate bearing in mind the receiver sensitivity and signal-to-interference-noise ratio threshold, thereby enforcing fast data forwarding. The performance of our protocol has been evaluated in the perspectives of end-to-end delay, control overhead, and packet delivery ratio using NS3 simulator in which enormous simulations have been conducted under the base of UAVs' density, packet rate and constant bit rate connections. Simulation results summarize that MDRMA contributes efficiently in mitigating the network instability through generating fast and stable routes and reducing link failures.

This new technology comes with new risks-increasing traffic congestion and concerns over safety; it also comes with new opportunities-massively distributed information and communication systems.

Many retailers have begun to utilize a drone-based aerial delivery system as an alternative solution to overcome the problems related to the high transportation costs and traffic jams in large cities.

This research focuses on the formulation of fixed-final-time multiphase optimal control problem with energy consumption as the performance index for a multirotor eVTOL aircraft. The proposed multiphase optimal control problem formulation and the numerical solution enables a multirotor eVTOL aircraft to meet the assigned required time of arrival and achieve an energy-efficient arrival trajectory for a given concept of operation (CONOP), which is a critical enabler for the safe and efficient future eVTOL operations for passenger transportation and cargo delivery. The problem formulation is applied to a UAM passenger transportation use case with EHang 184eVTOL aircraft, and an Uber-proposed vertiport for five different types of CONOPs. Finally, the energy consumed for all the CONOPs is compared to propose the most energy-efficient CONOP for a multirotor eVTOL on UAM passenger transportation mission. The proposed framework can also be used to address an energy-efficient cargo delivery application in a UAS traffic management context.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Throughput Maximization for UAV-Enabled Relaying in Wireless Powered Communication Networks Abstract: For elderly persons, a fall can cause serious injuries such as a hip fracture or head injury. Here, an advanced first aid system is proposed for monitoring elderly patients with heart conditions that puts them at risk of falling and for providing first aid supplies using an unmanned aerial vehicle. A hybridized fall detection algorithm (FDB-HRT) is proposed based on a combination of acceleration and a heart rate threshold. Five volunteers were invited to evaluate the performance of the heartbeat sensor relative to a benchmark device, and the extracted data was validated using statistical analysis. In addition, the accuracy of fall detections and the recorded locations of fall incidents were validated. The proposed FDB-HRT algorithm was 99.16% and 99.2% accurate with regard to heart rate measurement and fall detection, respectively. In addition, the geolocation error of patient fall incidents based on a GPS module was evaluated by mean absolute error analysis for 17 different locations in three cities in Iraq. Mean absolute error was 1.08 x 10(-5)degrees and 2.01 x 10(-5)degrees for latitude and longitude data relative to data from the GPS Benchmark system. In addition, the results revealed that in urban areas, the UAV succeeded in all missions and arrived at the patient's locations before the ambulance, with an average time savings of 105 s. Moreover, a time saving of 31.81% was achieved when using the UAV to transport a first aid kit to the patient compared to an ambulance. As a result, we can conclude that when compared to delivering first aid via ambulance, our design greatly reduces delivery time. The proposed advanced first aid system outperformed previous systems presented in the literature in terms of accuracy of heart rate measurement, fall detection, and information messages and UAV arrival time.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Sensor Installation and Retrieval Operations Using an Unmanned Aerial Manipulator Abstract: Strawberry growers in Florida suffer from a lack of efficient and accurate yield forecasts for strawberries, which would allow them to allocate optimal labor and equipment, as well as other resources for harvesting, transportation, and marketing. Accurate estimation of the number of strawberry flowers and their distribution in a strawberry field is, therefore, imperative for predicting the coming strawberry yield. Usually, the number of flowers and their distribution are estimated manually, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. In this paper, we develop an automatic strawberry flower detection system for yield prediction with minimal labor and time costs. The system used a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) equipped with an RGB (red, green, blue) camera to capture near-ground images of two varieties (Sensation and Radiance) at two different heights (2 m and 3 m) and built orthoimages of a 402 m(2) strawberry field. The orthoimages were automatically processed using the Pix4D software and split into sequential pieces for deep learning detection. A faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), a state-of-the-art deep neural network model, was chosen for the detection and counting of the number of flowers, mature strawberries, and immature strawberries. The mean average precision (mAP) was 0.83 for all detected objects at 2 m heights and 0.72 for all detected objects at 3 m heights. We adopted this model to count strawberry flowers in November and December from 2 m aerial images and compared the results with a manual count. The average deep learning counting accuracy was 84.1% with average occlusion of 13.5%. Using this system could provide accurate counts of strawberry flowers, which can be used to forecast future yields and build distribution maps to help farmers observe the growth cycle of strawberry fields.", "label": "False"}

The use of drones could drastically decrease labour costs and has been hyped as a potential disruptor to the parcel delivery industry. Online retailers and delivery companies such as Amazon, are already filing up patents for the development of multi-level fulfilment centres for unmanned aerial vehicles or drone-beehives that would allow the deployment of this technology within built environment. A substantial amount of research has been carried out in the last years on the potential use of drones for parcel delivery, principally in the area of logistic optimisation. However, little is known about the potential market and economic viability of such services in Europe. This paper presents a modelling framework using EU-wide high-resolution population and land-use data to estimate the potential optimal location of drone-beehives based on economic viability criterion. It estimates the potential number of EU28 citizens that could potentially benefit from last mile-drone delivery services under four scenarios. The performed analyses indicates that under the scenario considered as the most technologically realistic, up to 7% of EU citizens could get access to such services. When considering technological improvements scenarios, the share reaches 30%. Furthermore, results suggest that due to the differences in population and land-use patterns in the different Member States, the potential drone coverage across Europe could be very heterogeneous, with the UK, Germany, Italy and France appearing as the most likely countries where drone-beehives may have the most efficient development.", "label": "False"}

The complementary capabilities of the drone and the truck pose an innovative delivery mode. The relevant optimisation problem associated with this new mode, known as the travelling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D), aims to find the coordinated routes of a drone and a truck to serve a list of customers. In practice, managers sometimes intend to attain a compromise between operational cost and completion time. Therefore, this article addresses a bi-objective TSP-D considering both objectives. An improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-II) is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the label algorithm-based decoding method, the fast non-dominated sorting approach, the crowding-distance computation procedure, and the local search component are devised to accommodate the features of the problem. Furthermore, the first Pareto front obtained by the INSGA-II is improved by a post-optimisation component. Computational results validate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, the trade-off analysis demonstrates the relationship between operational cost and completion time and provides managerial insights for managers designing reasonable compromise routes.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Mapping surface breakages of the 2018 Hualien earthquake by using UAS photogrammetry Abstract: One drug, two diseases is a rare and economical therapeutic strategy that is highly desirable in the pharmaceutical industry. We previously reported a 21-amino acid peptide named beta-structured inhibitor for neurodegenerative diseases (BIND) that can effectively inhibit expanded CAG trinucleotide toxicity in polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. Here we report that BIND also effectively inhibits GGGGCC repeat-mediated neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo. When fused with a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein of the HIV, TAT-BIND reduces cell death, formation of GGGGCC RNA foci, and levels of poly-GR, poly-GA, and poly-GP dipeptide proteins in cell models of C9ORF72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS-FTD). We showed that TAT-BIND disrupts the interaction between GGGGCC RNA and nucleolin protein, restores rRNA maturation, and inhibits mislocalization of nucleolin and B23, which eventually suppresses nucleolar stress in C9ALS-FTD. In a Drosophila model of C9ALS-FTD, TAT-BIND suppresses retinal degeneration, rescues climbing ability, and extends the lifespan of flies. In contrast, TAT-BIND has no effect on UAS-poly-glycine-arginine (poly-GR)(100)-expressing flies, which generate only poly-GR protein toxicity, indicating BIND ameliorates toxicity in C9ALS-FTD models via a (r)(GGGGCC)(exp)-dependent inhibitory mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that, apart from being a potential therapeutic for polyQ diseases, BIND is also a potent peptidylic inhibitor that suppresses expanded GGGGCC RNA-mediated neurodegeneration, highlighting its potential application in C9ALS-FTD treatment.", "label": "False"}

In this study, we implemented a speed detection system for multiple moving objects on the ground from a moving platform in the air. A detect-and-track approach is used for primary tracking of the objects. Faster R-CNN (region-based convolutional neural network) is applied to detect the objects, and a discriminative correlation filter with CSRT (channel and spatial reliability tracking) is used for tracking. Feature-based image alignment (FBIA) is done for each frame to get the proper object location. In addition, SSIM (structural similarity index measurement) is performed to check how similar the current frame is with respect to the object detection frame.

{"text": "Title: Battery-Aware Operation Range Estimation for Terrestrial and Aerial Electric Vehicles Abstract: In the growing Internet of Things context, thousands of computing devices with various functionalities are producing data (from environmental sensors or other sources). However, they are also collecting, storing, processing and transmitting data to eventually communicate them securely to third parties (e.g., owners of devices or cloud data storage). The deployed devices are often battery-powered mobile or static nodes equipped with sensors and/or actuators, and they communicate using wireless technologies. Examples include unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless sensor nodes, smart beacons, and wearable health objects. Such resource-constrained devices include Active Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) nodes, and these are used to illustrate our proposal. In most scenarios, these nodes are unattended in an adverse environment, so data confidentiality must be ensured from the sensing phase through to delivery to authorized entities: in other words, data must be securely stored and transmitted to prevent attack by active adversaries even if the nodes are captured. However, due to the scarce resources available to nodes in terms of energy, storage, and/or computation, the proposed security solution has to be lightweight. In this article, we propose a serverless protocol to enable Mobile Data Collectors (MDCs), such as drones, to securely collect data from mobile and static Active RFID nodes and then deliver them later to an authorized third party. The whole solution ensures data confidentiality at each step (from the sensing phase, before data collection by the MDC, once data have been collected by MDC, and during final delivery), while fulfilling the lightweight requirements for the resource-limited entities involved. To assess the suitability of the protocol against the performance requirements, it was implemented on the most resource-constrained devices to get the worst possible results. In addition, to prove the protocol fulfills the security requirements, it was analyzed using security games and also formally verified using the AVISPA and ProVerif tools.", "label": "False"}

In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled WSN, where a flying UAV is employed to collect data from multiple sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to maximize the minimum average data collection rate from all SNs subject to a prescribed reliability constraint for each SN by jointly optimizing the UAV communication scheduling and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory. Different from the existing works that assume the simplified line-of-sight (LoS) UAV-ground channels, we consider the more practically accurate angle-dependent Rician fading channels between the UAV and SNs with the Rician factors determined by the corresponding UAV-SN elevation angles. However, the formulated optimization problem is intractable due to the lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter termed effective fading power that characterizes the achievable rate given the reliability requirement in terms of outage probability. To tackle this difficulty, we first approximate the parameter by a logistic (\"S\" shape) function with respect to the 3D UAV trajectory by using the data regression method. Then, the original problem is reformulated to an approximate form, which, however, is still challenging to solve due to its non-convexity. As such, we further propose an efficient algorithm to derive its suboptimal solution by using the block coordinate descent technique, which iteratively optimizes the communication scheduling, the UAV's horizontal trajectory, and its vertical trajectory. The latter two subproblems are shown to be non-convex, while locally optimal solutions are obtained for them by using the successive convex approximation technique. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and draw new insights on the 3D UAV trajectory under the Rician fading as compared to conventional LoS channel models.", "label": "False"}

The highways are severely threatened by rockfalls or landslide events after the 2017 Ms 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake. Field survey (September 14-18th, 2017, May 15-20th, 2018, and September 9-17th, 2018), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and satellite image identified high-relief rockfalls and road construction rockfalls or landslides along the highway. Rockfall hazard is qualitatively evaluated using block count, velocity, and flying height through a 3D rockfall simulation at local and regional scales. Rockfall risk is quantitatively assessed with rockfall event probability, propagation probability, spatial probability, and vulnerability for different block volume classes. Approximately 21.5%, 20.5%, and 5.3% of the road mileage was found to be subject to an unacceptable (UA) risk class for vehicles along S301, Z120, and Z128 highways, respectively. Approximately 20.1% and 3.3% of the road mileage belong to the UA risk class for tourists along Z120 and Z128 highways, respectively. Results highlighted that high-relief rockfall events were intensively located at K50 to K55 (Guanmenzi to Ganheba) and K70 to K72 (Jiudaoguai to Shangsizhai Village) road mileages along S301 highway and KZ18 to KZ22 (Five Flower Lake to Arrow Bamboo Lake) road mileages, KZ30 (Swan Lake to Virgin Forests), and KY10.5 kilometers in Jiuzhai Valley. Rockfalls in these locations were classified under the UA risk class and medium to very high hazard index.

A considerable number of works have studied different aspects of drone package delivery service by a supplier, one of which is delivery planning. However, existing works addressing the planning issues consider a simple case of perfect delivery without service interruption, e.g., due to accident, which is common and realistic. Therefore, this paper introduces the joint ground and aerial delivery service optimization and planning (GADOP) framework. The framework explicitly incorporates uncertainty of drone package delivery, i.e., takeoff and breakdown conditions. The GADOP framework aims to minimize the total delivery cost, given practical constraints, e.g., travelling distance limit. Specifically, we formulate the GADOP framework as a three-stage stochastic integer programming model. To deal with the high complexity issue of the problem, a decomposition method is adopted. Then, the performance of the GADOP framework is evaluated by using two data sets including the Solomon benchmark suite and the real data from one of the Singapore logistics companies.

Four different turbulence models for low-Reynolds-number flow are compared with the experimental data for a NACA 0018 airfoil over a range of two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional (3-D) conditions.

In this paper, a method to estimate the source term of a gaseous release using measurements of concentration obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is described.

{"text": "Title: Gully headcut susceptibility modeling using functional trees, naive Bayes tree, and random forest models Abstract: Change detection of high resolution topographic data is commonly used in river valleys to quantify reach- and site-scale sediment budgets by estimating the erosion/deposition volume, and to interpret the geomorphic processes driving erosion and deposition. Field survey data are typically collected as point clouds that are often converted to gridded raster datasets and the ultimate choice of grid resolution is left to the user. This choice may have important implications for both the quantification and interpretation of geomorphic change. Here we used concurrent topographic data collected by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry to quantify the influence of grid resolution and sampling technique on (a) the sediment budget and (b) the presence and role of geomorphic processes (i.e., alluvial, colluvial, aeolian, and fluvial transport) driving topographic change at four sites along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. We found that while both techniques produced similar estimates for site-scale sediment budgets, the magnitude of detected topographic change was dampened at coarser pixel resolutions. An overall decrease in the areal extent of erosion and deposition were observed, respectively, when coarsening pixel size from 5 cm to 1 m among all sites. Coarser resolution data tended to affect interpretation of landscape change along the margins of river valleys. For example, when changing from 5 cm to 1 m pixel resolution, the inferred contribution of aeolian changes to total site-scale geomorphic change increased in area by 7.9%, whereas the inferred contribution of alluvial and colluvial processes decreased in area by 97.9% and 88.2%, respectively. More generally, we found that coarsening pixel sizes disproportionately attributed geomorphic change to one or more of the most common processes operating at a site. We also found that coarsening pixel resolution amplified the net sediment imbalance at the site scale, driving the imbalance at erosional sites further into erosion and vice versa for depositional sites. Our results have implications both for point cloud data collection and for raster dataset processing. We argue that selecting the finest obtainable resolution is not always warranted to accurately quantify and interpret geomorphic change, because remote sensing technique, topographic data resolution, and analysis procedure can be optimized to capture the spatial scale of those processes driving landscape change. However, in landscapes at or near sediment equilibrium (i.e., equal amounts of erosion and deposition), the finest obtainable topographic data resolution is warranted to avoid amplifying sediment imbalance and erroneously inferring that sites are trending toward erosion or deposition.

One-hundred and twenty-seven GHs were identified and randomly divided into a training dataset comprised of 70% (89) of the GHs, and a validation dataset encompassing 30% (38) of the GHs. Twenty-two GHs conditioning factors were input into the models. The results of the chi-square analysis confirmed land use (90.8%) had the greatest influence on GHs occurrence. The results of training indicated that the AUC value for the FT, NBTree, and RF models were 83.4%, 94.8%, and 96.5%, respectively. The confidence interval (CI) for these methods was 0.771-0.885, 0.905-0.975, and 0.926-0.987, respectively. The highest standard error (SE) was related to the FT model (0.0314), followed by NBTree (0.0151), and RF (0.0119). The validation results indicated an AUC of 0.888, 0.947, and 0.981 for these methods, respectively. Therefore, RF was found to be the most effective model for predicting and mapping GHs in the future.", "label": "False"}

By using this setup, a field experiment was carried out to investigate the vertical profiles of RH, temperature, PNSD ranged from 8 to 245 nm, and particle number concentration with the diameter ranges of 0.3-0.5 mu m and 0.5-1.0 mu m from the ground up to 300 m above ground level in a rural site of the North China Plain. New particle formation (NPF) event in a vertical scale was observed during the daytime cruises. The newly formed particles showed a heterogeneous vertical distribution, indicating the inhomogeneous occurrence of the NPF event vertically. During the daytime, the vertical variations in number concentration of particles larger than 0.3 mu m was not obvious, while, showed a tendency to decrease associated with the increasing altitude in the evening. The newly-developed unmanned aerial vehicle research platform could be applied to study the vertical NPF events and transport processes of air pollutants within the atmospheric boundary layer and urban canopy, and to monitor source emissions with the purpose of environment management.

{"text": "Title: Remote Scene Size-up Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in a Simulated Mass Casualty Incident Abstract: Debris-covered glaciers in the Himalaya play an important role in the high-altitude water cycle. The thickness of the debris layer is a key control of the melt rate of those glaciers, yet little is known about the relative importance of the three potential sources of debris supply: the rockwalls, the glacier bed and the lateral moraines. In this study, we hypothesize that mass movement from the lateral moraines is a significant debris supply to debris-covered glaciers, in particular when the glacier is disconnected from the rockwall due to downwasting. To test this hypothesis, eight high-resolution and accurate digital elevation models from the lateral moraines of the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in Nepal are used. These are created using structure from motion (SfM), based on images captured using an unmanned aerial vehicle between May 2013 and April 2018. The analysis shows that mass transport results in an elevation change on the lateral moraines with an average rate of - 0.31 +/- 0.26 m year(-1) during this period, partly related to sub-moraine ice melt. There is a higher elevation change rate observed in the monsoon (-0.39 +/- 0.74 m year(-1)) than in the dry season (-0.23 +/- 0.68 m year(-1)). The lower debris aprons of the lateral moraines decrease in elevation at a faster rate during both seasons, probably due to the melt of ice below. The surface lowering rates of the upper gullied moraine, with no ice core below, translate into an annual increase in debris thickness of 0.08 m year(-1) along a narrow margin of the glacier surface, with an observed absolute thickness of approximately 1 m, reducing melt rates of underlying glacier ice. Further research should focus on how large this negative feedback is in controlling melt and how debris is redistributed on the glacier surface.", "label": "False"}

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) may potentially enhance the scene-size-up with real-time visual feedback during chaotic, evolving or inaccessible events. We performed this study to test the feasibility of paramedics using UAV video from a simulated MCI to identify scene hazards, initiate patient triage, and designate key operational locations. Methods: We simulated an MCI, including 15 patients plus 4 hazards, on a college campus. A UAV surveyed the scene, capturing video of all patients, hazards, surrounding buildings and streets. We invited attendees of a provincial paramedic meeting to participate. Participants received a lecture on Sort-Assess-Lifesaving Interventions-Treatment/Transport (SALT) Triage and MCI scene management principles. Next, they watched the UAV video footage. We directed participants to sort patients according to SALT Triage Step One, identify injuries, and to localize the patients within the campus. Additionally, we asked them to select a start point for SALT Triage Step Two, identify and locate hazards, and designate locations for an Incident Command Post, Treatment Area, Transport Area and Access/Egress routes. The primary outcome was the number of correctly allocated triage scores. Results: Ninety-six individuals participated. Mean age was 35 years (SD 11); 46% (44) were female and 49% (47) were Primary Care Paramedics. Most participants (79; 82%) correctly sorted at least 12 of 15 patients. Increased age was associated with decreased triage accuracy [-0.04(-0.07, -0.01); p = 0.031]. Fifty-two (54%) correctly localized 12 or more patients to a 27 x 20m grid area. Advanced paramedic certification, and local residency were associated with improved patient localization [2.47(0.23,4.72); p = 0.031], [3.36(1.10,5.61); p = 0.004]. The majority of participants (70; 81%) chose an acceptable location to start SALT Triage Step Two and 75 (78%) identified at least 3 of 4 hazards. Approximately half (53; 56%) of participants appropriately designated 4 or more of 5 key operational areas.

{"text": "Title: Improved Altitude Control Algorithm for Quadcopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Abstract: In the practical application, such as military, logistics or drone control, in order to meet the mission needs, the scale of multi-agent systems is constantly expanding, and the number of leaders required to implement control is increasing. In containment control, it has some difficulties in forming convex hulls by traditional control methods to achieve ideal control purposes. We propose a method that is more suitable and effective for large-scale networks to achieve containment control here. In this paper, a controllable containment control algorithm based on hierarchical clustering for multi-agent systems is proposed by combining the topology optimisation theory and complex network controllability theory. First, the multi-agent network is divided into several communities according to the hierarchical clustering algorithm. Then the maximum matching algorithm of bipartite graph is used to determine the minimum leader set satisfying the network controllability. Second, the corresponding control protocols are designed for the agents, and a position adjustment control force is introduced to adjust the motion of individuals that are located outside the convex hull in the process of containment among the communities. Therefore, when achieving and maintaining the controllable containment control within the community, the controllable containment control among the communities can be achieved effectively through the proposed algorithm.

{"text": "Title: Auction-Based Charging Scheduling With Deep Learning Framework for Multi-Drone Networks Abstract: Industry 4.0 has paved the way for a world where smart factories will automate and upgrade many processes through the use of some of the latest emerging technologies. One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantly reduced their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength.

{"text": "Title: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle based Reliable and Energy Efficient Data Collection from Red Alerted Area using Wireless Sensor Networks with IoT Abstract: State-of-the-art drone technologies have severe flight time limitations due to weight constraints, which inevitably lead to a relatively small amount of available energy. Therefore, frequent battery replacement or recharging is necessary in applications such as delivery, exploration, or support to the wireless infrastructure. Mobile charging stations (i.e., mobile stations with charging equipment) for outdoor ad-hoc battery charging is one of the feasible solutions to address this issue. However, the ability of these platforms to charge the drones is limited in terms of the number and charging time. This paper designs an auction-based mechanism to control the charging schedule in multi-drone setting. In this paper, charging time slots are auctioned, and their assignment is determined by a bidding process. The main challenge in developing this framework is the lack of prior knowledge on the distribution of the number of drones participating in the auction. Based on optimal second-price-auction, the proposed formulation, then, relies on deep learning algorithms to learn such distribution online. Numerical results from extensive simulations show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach provides effective battery charging control in multi-drone scenarios.", "label": "False"}

In the proposed work, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based Reliable and Energy Efficient Data Collection Mechanism (REEDCM) is introduced using Wireless Sensor Networks with the Internet of Things (IoT). It mainly focuses on the effective data collection from the man un-attended area (i.e., red alerted area) including nuclear disaster zone, volcanic eruption, forest fire, and battlefield, etc. Battery energy is a major constraint of the WSNs, thus an efficient data collection mechanism is needed to enhance the energy efficiency and scalability. In REEDCM, a novel clustering mechanism is presented which selects the Cluster Head (CH) based on the residual energy, speed and number of neighbors. Besides, the UAV Data Collector (UAV_DC) is used to gather the data directly from the CHs which in turn transmits the collected data to the Base Station (BS), then the BS shares the sensor information to the users through the Internet.

{"text": "Title: Proposal to planning facility location using UAV and geographic information systems in a post-disaster scenario Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things, how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of interest.", "label": "False"}

However, traditional network data collection consumes a high amount of energy because of data packets that need to be routed on a hop-by-hop basis to the base station. To alleviate this problem, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have been used to travel over the sensed environment to collect data. The time and motion constraints of UAVs mean that they require the shortest and smoothest paths to address these constraints. So, the shortest path is planned based on Travelling Sales Problem (TSP), and to smoothen the path, we used Bezier curves to convert paths that are flyable.

Along with an efficient initial deployment, this paper presents a two-fold approach to handle hot zones. First, the loads in overlapped sections are redistributed to neighbors. Second, a distributed algorithm is run that dynamically repositions the least number of UAVs to serve the maximum possible users. Additionally, to balance the user demand and supply of wireless coverage, adjacent UAVs are allowed to swap their positions.

In parallel, several applications are being envisioned that bring together a swarm of multiple networked micro air vehicles to accomplish large tasks in coordination. However, it is still very challenging to deploy multiple micro air vehicles concurrently. To address this challenge, we have developed an open software/hardware platform called the University at Buffalo's Airborne Networking and Communications Testbed (UB-ANC), and an associated emulation framework called the UB-ANC Emulator.

We demonstrate the UB-ANC Emulator's accuracy against experimental data collected in two mission scenarios: a simple mission with three networked micro air vehicles and a sophisticated coverage path planning mission with a single micro air vehicle. To accurately reflect the performance of a micro air vehicle swarm where communication links are subject to interference and packet losses, and protocols at the data link, network, and transport layers affect network throughput, latency, and reliability, we integrate the open-source discrete-event network simulator ns-3 into the UB-ANC Emulator.

However, it remains unclear whether it increases herbicide use overall in the long term for communities that use no-till as their primary source of conservation agriculture. The preponderance of literature suggests that no-till has increased herbicide use, but it is difficult to quantify howmuch herbicide has increased in a given location and to directly correlate changes in herbicide use to changes in soil andwater quality. This paper provides severalmethods to determine howherbicide use has changed over timein an agricultural community in Oregon that switched over to no-till in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These methods include: spatial analysis of remote sensing satellite imagery of vegetation health along streams; use of a drone fitted with an agricultural camera to detect vegetation health; and soil, sediment, and water sampling for the most commonly used herbicides in the study area. By using these methods, this study shows where streamvegetation health continues to be an issue in the agricultural community, and where concentrations of a commonly used herbicide in the community may be impacting human and ecological health. This study has important implications for impacts to soil and water quality over time in agricultural communities, as many researchers have noted the need to determine the long term effects of conversion to no-till and other forms of conservation agriculture.

{"text": "Title: Tracking and Simulating Pedestrian Movements at Intersections Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Abstract: Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) affects some 275,000 individuals in Europe each year. Time from collapse to defibrillation is essential for survival. As emergency medical services (EMS) response times in Sweden have increased, novel methods are needed to facilitate early treatment. Unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e. drones) have potential to deliver automated external defibrillators (AED). The aim of this simulation study was to explore bystanders' experience of a simulated OHCA-situation where a drone delivers an AED and how the situation is affected by having one or two bystanders onsite. Methods: This explorative simulation study used a mixed methodology describing bystanders' experiences of retrieving an AED delivered by a drone in simulated OHCA situations. Totally eight participants were divided in two groups of bystanders a) alone or b) in pairs and performed CPR on a manikin for 5 minutes after which an AED was delivered by a drone at 50m from the location. Qualitative data from observations, interviews of participants and video recordings were analysed using content analysis alongside descriptive data on time delays during bystander interaction. Results: Three categories of bystander experiences emerged: 1) technique and preparedness, 2) support through conversation with the dispatcher, and 3) aid and decision-making. The main finding was that retrieval of an AED as delivered by a drone was experienced as safe and feasible for bystanders. None of the participants hesitated to retrieve the AED; instead they experienced it positive, helpful and felt relief upon AED-drone arrival and were able to retrieve and attach the AED to a manikin. Interacting with the AED-drone was perceived as less difficult than performing CPR or handling their own mobile phone during T-CPR. Single bystander simulation introduced a significant hands-off interval when retrieving the AED, a period lasting 94s (range 75s-110s) with one participant compared to 0s with two participants. Conclusion: The study shows that it made good sense for bystanders to interact with a drone in this simulated suspected OHCA. Bystanders experienced delivery of AED as safe and feasible. This has potential implications, and further studies on bystanders' experiences in real cases of OHCA in which a drone delivers an AED are therefore necessary.", "label": "False"}

Due to the unsteady nature of the atmosphere, predicting how material will be transported via the Earth's wind field is challenging. Lagrangian diagnostics, such as Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), have been used to discover the most significant regions of material collection or dispersion. However, Lagrangian diagnostics can be time-consuming to calculate and often rely on weather forecasts that may not be completely accurate. Recently, Eulerian diagnostics have been developed which can provide indications of LCS and have computational advantages over their Lagrangian counterparts. In this paper, a methodology is developed for estimating local Eulerian diagnostics from wind velocity data measured by a single fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) flying in a circular arc. Using a simulation environment, driven by realistic atmospheric velocity data from the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model, it is shown that the Eulerian diagnostic estimates from UAS measurements approximate the true local Eulerian diagnostics and also predict the passage of LCSs. This methodology requires only a single flying UAS, making it easier and more affordable to implement in the field than existing alternatives, such as multiple UASs and Dopler LiDAR measurements.

To test their feasibility in characterizing the properties and dynamics of fast ice, three flights were carried out in the 2016-2017 austral summer during the 33rd Chinese National Antarctic Expedition (CHINARE), focusing on the area of the Prydz Bay in East Antarctica. Three-dimensional models and orthomosaics from three sorties were constructed from a total of 205 photos using Agisoft PhotoScan software. Logistical challenges presented by the terrain precluded the deployment of a dedicated ground control network; however, it was still possible to indirectly assess the performance of the photogrammetric products through an analysis of the statistics of the matching network, bundle adjustment, and Monte-Carlo simulation. Our results show that the matching networks are quite strong, given a sufficient number of feature points (mostly > 20,000) or valid matches (mostly > 1000). The largest contribution to the total error using our direct georeferencing approach is attributed to inaccuracies in the onboard position and orientation system (POS) records, especially in the vehicle height and yaw angle. On one hand, the 3D precision map reveals that planimetric precision is usually about one-third of the vertical estimate (typically 20 cm in the network centre). On the other hand, shape-only errors account for less than 5% for the X and Y dimensions and 20% for the Z dimension.

Nevertheless, constrained by limited battery capacities, the hovering time of UAVs is quite limited, prohibiting them from serving a wide area. To cater with remote sensing applications, people often employ vehicles to transport, launch, and recycle them. The so-called vehicledrone cooperation (VDC) benefits from both the far driving distance of vehicles and the high mobility of UAVs. Efficient routing and scheduling can greatly reduce time consumption and financial expenses incurred in VDC. However, previous works in vehicle-drone cooperative sensing considered only one drone, thus unable to simultaneously cover multiple targets distributed in an area. Using multiple drones to sense different targets in parallel can significantly promote efficiency and expand service areas. Therefore, we propose a novel problem, referred to as vehicle-assisted multidrone routing and scheduling problem. To tackle the problem, we contribute an efficient algorithm, referred to as vehicle-assisted multi-UAV routing and scheduling algorithm (VURA). In VURA, we maintain and iteratively update a memory containing candidate UAV routes. VURA works by iteratively deriving solutions based on UAV routes picked from the memory. In every iteration, VURA jointly optimizes anchor point selection, path planning, and tour assignment via nested optimization operations.

Results: Delayed bleeding developed at a median 11.6 days (range: 2 -34 days) after cesarean section (n =19) and vaginal delivery(n = Is). On angiography, diffuse hypervascularity was detected in 24 patients, pseudoaneurysm in 11, active extravasation in 1, and arteriovenous malformation in 1.

The metrics derived from the point clouds are therefore likely to differ, potentially leading to different inputs for entrainment threshold models, different trends in surface layer development being identified and different trajectories for physical processes and habitat quality being predicted. This paper provides a direct comparison between TLS and SfMp surveys of an exposed gravel bar for three different survey periods following inundation and reworking of the bar surface during high flow events. The point clouds derived from the two methods are used to describe changes in the character of the surface layer between bar inundation events, and comparisons are made with descriptions derived from conventional pebble counts. The results found differences in the metrics derived using each method do exist, but the grid resolution used to detrend the surfaces and identify spatial variations in surface layer characteristics had a greater impact than survey method. Further research is required to understand the significance of these variations for quantifying surface texture and structure and for predicting entrainment thresholds and transport rates.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Secure UAV-to-UAV Systems With Spatially Random UAVs Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiple model (MM) method for aircraft conflict detection and resolution (CDR) in intent andweather uncertainty for the next generation air transportation system. It is based on probabilisticMMaircraft trajectory prediction. Conflict detection is performed through the use of predicted probability of conflict (PC). An improved algorithm for estimating PC is proposed and compared with a commonly used method. Conflict resolution (CR) is formulated as a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) problem subject to a constraint on the predicted PC to guarantee safety of the optimized CR trajectories. The cost function to be minimized is tailored to the CR problem and includes the cost of performing evasive maneuvers as well as the average cost incurred by extra travel distance to the destination due to the maneuvers. An efficient algorithm for finding the optimal path (maneuver sequence), with respect to the maneuver cost, is proposed and extended to an overall CDR optimization algorithm for the total cost, in order to produce optimized conflict-free CR trajectories. The proposed search algorithm is essentially a generalization of an optimal list Viterbi algorithm (for unconstrained minimization through a trellis) to the constrained case of our MPC-based CDR problem. The capability and computational efficiency of the proposed MM-CDR method (including PC prediction, optimal search, and overall CDR) are evaluated via comprehensive simulation of a large variety of unmanned aerial vehicle \"sense-and-avoid\" encounter scenarios, and are compared with existing methods in the literature.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Recording inter-annual changes on a boulder beach in Galicia, NW Spain using an unmanned aerial vehicle Abstract: The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is an extension of the classic capacitated vehicle routing problem, where not only trucks but drones are used to deliver parcels to customers. One distinctive feature of the VRPD is that a drone may travel with a truck, take off from its stop to serve customers, and land at a service hub to travel with another truck as long as the flying range and loading capacity limitations are satisfied. Routing trucks and drones in an integrated manner makes the problem much more challenging and different from classical vehicle routing literature. We propose a mixed integer programming model, and develop a branch-and-price algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on the instances randomly generated in a practical setting, and the results demonstrate the good computational performance of the proposed algorithm.

Digital surface models (DSMs) with 1.8cm resolution were constructed from the 2014 and 2016 data to identify changes in beach morphology over the intervening period. Analyses were conducted using a Limit of Detection (LoD) of 0cm and 3.71cm. In both cases, the analyses showed that erosion dominated over 19% of the beach area. Accretion occurred over the rest of the beach, which acquired an additional 1500m(3) of material over the study period. Re-analysis of the data from earlier flights suggested that erosion dominated on the beach in 2012-2013 and deposition in 2013-2014. Without any clear relationship between beach behaviour and storm severity during each winter period, it is proposed that gravitationally induced erosion and storm-wave induced deposition are the result of perturbations about an equilibrium beach gradient. The UAV data also suggested that an essentially random component modulates regional patterns of movement. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: What relevant information can be identified by experts on unmanned aerial vehicles' visible images for precision viticulture? Abstract: The stability indicating HPLC method for the determination of dronedarone (DRO) hydrochloride in tablets and in inclusion complexes with cyclodextrin was carried out on a C18 column using a buffer solution (0.3% glacial acetic acid; pH 4.9) and acetonitrile (35:65, v/v) as mobile phase. The method validation according to ICH guidelines demonstrated acceptable results. Dronedarone was exposed to stress conditions, and drug-degradation kinetics was studied. Additionally, the degraded samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry and the preliminary toxicity against 3T3 cells was also determined. The results obtained evidenced that dronedarone degradation kinetics in alkaline conditions followed first-order reaction and that inclusion complexation with cyclodextrin reduced its chemical degradation. Among the samples exposed to stress conditions, only the photodegraded samples presented cytotoxic effects. Moreover, assay results were compared to a previously validated micellar electrokinetic chromatography method, showing non-significant difference (p>0.05). The combination of HPLC, mass spectrometry and cytotoxicity study could be an important tool for the screening of DRO pharmaceutical forms, improving quality and safety in the development of novel drug delivery systems.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: UAV-Assisted Supporting Services Connectivity in Urban VANETs Abstract: The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used.

{"text": "Title: Estimating fractional cover of tundra vegetation at multiple scales using unmanned aerial systems and optical satellite data Abstract: To keep the services and applications of intelligent transportation system stable and active, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are considered as an essential building block to maintain and manage its features. A wide deployment of VANETs is possible only after addressing numerous research challenges. One of the most complicated issues consists of designing a routing strategy, taking into consideration several serious constraints, and especially in a network such as VANET. The severity of these issues would be increased significantly when a VANET is deployed over an urban area, where we distinguish the high mobility of nodes and existing obstructions (e.g., buildings, bridges, tunnels, etc.). In this paper, an efficient routing solution based on a flooding technique is conceived to make the data delivery more reliable and to guarantee robust paths. Vehicles can cooperate in ad hoc fashion with existing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This kind of collaboration provides reliable routing paths and ensures alternative solutions in the case of path failures. Furthermore, a prediction technique is used to expect the expiration time of each discovered path. To limit the overhead over the network, all control packets are characterized by their static size making the originality of this work. Based on the simulation outputs, we discuss the performances of the proposed approach as compared with other dedicated previous schemes in terms of several metrics. The obtained results demonstrate that the hybrid communication between vehicles and UAVs based on the proposed flooding technique is perfectly suited to improve the data delivery process.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Assessing herbicide symptoms by using a logarithmic field sprayer Abstract: Fractional cover of green vegetation (FCover) is a key variable when observing Arctic vegetation under a changing climate. Vegetation changes over large areas are traditionally monitored by linking plot-scale measurements to satellite data. However, integrating field and satellite data is not straightforward. Typically, the satellite data are at a much coarser scale in comparison to field measurements. Here, we studied how Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) can be used to bridge this gap. We covered three 250 m x 250 m sites in Fennoscandian tundra with varying productivity ana FCover, ranging from barren vegetation to shrub tundra. The UAS sites were then used to train satellite data-based FCover models. First, we created a binary vegetation classification (absent, present) by using UAS-derived RGB-orthomosaics and logistic regression. Secondly, we used the classification to calculate FCover to Planet CubeSat (3 m), Sentinel-2A MSI (10 m, 20 m), and Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) grids, and examined how well FCover is explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VI) derived from satellite data. The overall classification accuracies for the UAS sites were >= 90%. The UAS-FCover were strongly related to the tested VIs (D-2 89% at best). The explained deviance was generally higher for coarser resolution data, indicating that the effect of data resolution should be taken into account when comparing results from different sensors. VIs based on red-edge (at 740 nm, 783 nm), or near-infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) had the highest performance. We recommend wider inspection of red-edge and SWIR bands for future Arctic vegetation research. Our results demonstrate that UASs can be used for observing FCover at multiple scales. Individual UAS sites can serve as focus areas, which provide information at the finest resolution (e.g. individual plants), whereas a sample of several UAS sites can be used to train satellite data and examine vegetation over larger extents.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Quantification of bedform dynamics and bedload sediment flux in sandy braided rivers from airborne and satellite imagery Abstract: BACKGROUND In field experiments, assessment of herbicide selectivity and efficacy rarely takes advantage of dose-response regressions. The objective is to demonstrate that logarithmic sprayers, which automatically make a logarithmic dilution of a herbicide rate, can extract biologically relevant parameters describing the efficacy of herbicides in crops, and compare localities and time of assessment. RESULTS In a conventional and an organic field, canola, white mustard, and no crop plots were sprayed with diflufenican and beflubutamid. A mixed effect log-logistic dose-response regression, with autoregressive correlation structure, estimated ED50 and ED90 for visual and Excess Green Index symptoms at various days after treatment (DAT). For visual assessment, ED50 differed within no crop between locations for beflubutamid at 12 DAT and 26 DAT. For diflufenican, the ED50 was different within crops at the two fields at 12 DAT, but not at 26 DAT. The Excess Green Indices at ED50 were not different among herbicides, locations, and corps; ED90 differed for white mustard and canola for beflubutamid but not for diflufenican. CONCLUSION Suitable nonlinear regression models are now available for fitting dose-response data from a logarithmic sprayer in field experiments.

{"text": "Title: Functions of traditional ponds in altering sediment budgets in the hilly area of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China Abstract: Images from specially-commissioned aeroplane sorties (manned aerial vehicle, MAV), repeat unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys, and Planet CubeSat satellites are used to quantify dune and bar dynamics in the sandy braided South Saskatchewan River, Canada. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques and application of a depth-brightness model are used to produce a series of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) at low and near-bankfull flows. A number of technical and image processing challenges are described that arise from the application of SfM in dry and submerged environments. A model for best practice is presented and analysis suggests a depth-brightness model approach can represent the different scales of bedforms present in sandy braided rivers with low-turbidity and shallow (< 2 m deep) water. The aerial imagery is used to quantify the spatial distribution of unit bar and dune migration rate in an 18 km reach and three 1 km long reaches respectively. Dune and unit bar migration rates are highly variable in response to local variations in planform morphology. Sediment transport rates for dunes and unit bars, obtained by integrating migration rates (from UAV) with the volume of sediment moved (from DSMs using MAV imagery) show near-equivalence in sediment flux. Hence, reach-based sediment transport rate estimates can be derived from unit bar data alone. Moreover, it is shown that reasonable estimates of sediment transport rate can be made using just unit bar migration rates as measured from 2D imagery, including from satellite images, so long as informed assumptions are made regarding average bar shape and height. With recent availability of frequent, repeat satellite imagery, and the ease of undertaking repeat MAV and UAV surveys, for the first time, it may be possible to provide global estimates of bedload sediment flux for large or inaccessible low-turbidity rivers that currently have sparse information on bedload sediment transport rates.

The cluster of ponds is a common landscape, which has traditionally been used for irrigation in the hilly area of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). However, little is known about how the landscape elements temporally changed over the past decades and if the ponds can be applied to function in balancing watershed sediments against soil erosion. The Jinglingxi watershed, covering 20.5 km(2), was selected as the study area. The changes in pond number, surface area, and drainage catchment were analyzed with aid of high-resolution typographical map and unmanned aerial vehicles imagery. The spatial WaTEM/SEDEM model was developed to simulate watershed soil erosion and sediment deposition under the absence and presence of water bodies scenarios. Results from different simulation scenarios were compared and revealed the napping effects of the multi-pond system. From 1983 to 2016, the number and total area of ponds roughly doubled. The density reached 30 ponds/km(2). From 1983 to 2016, the total drainage area of ponds increased from 13.22% to 35.4% of the whole watershed. The sediments deposited at the bottom of ponds can indicate the past specific sediment yield (SSY) in drainage catchments. Our results suggest that the multi-pond system not only reduce watershed sediment expont but also alter the sediment deposition in different land uses. The reduced sediments export is expected to prolong the service life of downstream reservoirs at the expectancy of ponds' storage capacities. The ecological compensation from downstream reservoirs' revenues to upstream regions should be established to drive dredging actions for the upstream ponds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

{"text": "Title: Spatial modelling of gully headcuts using UAV data and four best-first decision classifier ensembles (BFTree, Bag-BFTree, RS-BFTree, and RF-BFTree) Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and structure from motion with multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry are increasingly common tools for geoscience applications, but final product accuracy can be significantly diminished in the absence of a dense and well-distributed network of ground control points (GCPs). This is problematic in inaccessible or hazardous field environments, including highly crevassed glaciers, where implementing suitable GCP networks would be logistically difficult if not impossible. To overcome this challenge, we present an alternative geolocation approach known as GNSS-supported aerial triangulation (GNSS-AT). Here, an on-board carrier-phase GNSS receiver is used to determine the location of photo acquisitions using kinematic differential carrier-phase positioning. The camera positions can be used as the geospatial input to the photogrammetry process. We describe the implementation of this method in a low-cost, custom-built UAV and apply the method in a glaciological setting at Store Glacier in western Greenland. We validate the technique at the calving front, achieving topographic uncertainties of +/- 0.12 m horizontally (similar to 1.1 x the ground sampling distance) and +/- 0.14 m vertically (similar to 1.3 x the ground sampling distance), when flying at an altitude of similar to 450 m above ground level. This compares favourably with previous GCP-derived uncertainties in glacial environments and allows us to apply the SfM-MVS photogrammetry at an inland study site where ice flows at 2 m day(-1) and stable ground control is not available. Here, we were able to produce, without the use of GCPs, the first UAV-derived velocity fields of an ice sheet interior.

{"text": "Title: Creek Dynamics Determine Pond Subsurface Geochemical Heterogeneity in East Anglian (UK) Salt Marshes Abstract: Despite the importance of delineating spatial modelling of gully headcuts (GHs) in erosion-prone environments, assessments of the factors that control the occurrence of headcuts is lacking. To fill this gap in the research, we identified 129 GHs field surveys. These 129 cases were randomly divided into two groups: 90 GHs (70%) for model training and 39 GHs (30%) for model validation. Subsequently, new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is used to develop spatial modelling to predict the location of GHs at sites prone to soil erosion in Golestan Province, Iran. Mapping GHs enables evaluation of 4 machine-learning techniques (or ensembles) - best-first decision tree (BFTree), bagging best-first decision tree (Bag-BFTree), random-subspace best-first decision tree (RS-BFTree), and rotation-forest best-first decision tree (RF-BFTree) - for modelling GHs. We use the information-gain ratio method to analyze the relationships between GHs and 22 GH conditioning factors. The 4 ensemble outputs are validated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The areas under the curves (AUCs) for prediction rates of the ensemble methods applied to the training group are BFTree - 883%, Bag-BFTree - 92.7%, RS-BFTree - 95.7%, and RF-BFTree - 93.2%. The AUCs for the model-validation group cases, however, are 84.9%, 94.1%, 97.4%, and 9.18%, respectively. Therefore, RS-BFTree is, statistically, the most effective ensemble method for accurate modelling of GHs. Variable-importance analyses using information-gain ratio indicate that out of 22 GH-influential factors, land use, slope degree, and slope-length are of more importance in developing of GH occurrence.

A newly developed impactor is used for high-efficiency particle extraction on board the multicopter UAV. An airflow volume of 0.2m(3) min(-1) through the impactor is provided by a battery-powered blower and measured with an on-board mass flow sensor. A bell-mouth-shaped air inlet of the PCS is arranged and oriented on the multicopter UAV to provide substantial isokinetic sampling conditions by advantageously using the airflow pattern generated by the propellers of the multicopter UAV. More than 30 aerosol particle collection flights were carried out near Tubingen in March 2017 at altitudes of up to 300 m above ground level (a.g.l.),each with a sampled air volume of 2m(3). Pollen grains and spores of various genera, as well as large (> 20 mu m) opaque particles and fine dust particles, were collected, and specific concentrations of up to 100 particles per m(3) were determined by visual microscopic analysis.

{"text": "Title: Autonomous Navigation of UAVs in Large-Scale Complex Environments: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach Abstract: The 350-km long coast of Suriname, South America, is part of a unique system in the world characterized by large-scale mud supply from the Amazon and exposed to Atlantic waves. Large banks migrate alongshore from the Amazon to the Orinoco delta, separated by 'inter-bank' zones. Banks dissipate waves, partially weld onshore, and are colonized by mangroves, whereas waves in inter-bank areas cause shoreline erosion, mitigated where rare cheniers develop. Cheniers assure coastal protection and recreational and ecosystem services, notably providing nesting sites for marine turtles. Cheniers are also under pressure from sand mining. In order to gain a better understanding of how these cheniers form and evolve, a study was conducted on Braamspunt beach, a major turtle-nesting chenier in Suriname constructed from sand supplied by the Maroni River. Satellite images between 1987 and 2018 show a reduction of the alongshore extent of the chenier, following sand supply cut-off from the Maroni by a mud bank migrating westward towards the mouth of the Suriname River, exacerbated by mud-blanketing of sand. Commercial sand mining has further affected the beach, but mined volumes are not known. Field surveys (high-resolution topography, drone photogrammetry, wave measurements) conducted in February, 2016 highlight two chenier types depending on sand availability, transport and wave reworking: a high-tide reflective/low-tide dissipative and longshore transport-dominated type 1 exhibiting berm scarping, and a low, overwash-dominated type 2. As the mud-bank's leading edge impinges on the inter-bank trailing edge, sand sequestering by mud and storage in type 2 washovers entail less available sand downdrift. Type 1 lost over 4200 m(3) of sand in just 3-4 days. An increasingly deficient budget induces progressive change to type 2, morphodynamically better adapted to diminution of available sand, and epitomizing chenier fragmentation and isolation within the muddy Guianas coastal plain. By affecting the morphology and sand budget of Braamspunt, these changes lower opportunities for turtle-nesting. Further reduction of the length of exposed chenier is apparently halted near the Suriname River mouth where mud is liquefied by the outflowing river and tidal jet, but the continued existence of this preserved beach could be endangered by sand mining.", "label": "False"}

The main challenge in controlling this kind of system arises from the dynamic behavior imposed by the load, which is usually coupled to the UAV by means of a rope, adding unactuated degrees of freedom to the whole system. Furthermore, to perform the load transportation it is often needed the knowledge of the load position to accomplish the task. Since available sensors are commonly embedded in the mobile platform, information on the load position may not be directly available. To solve this problem in this work, initially, the kinematics of the multi-body mechanical system are formulated from the load's perspective, from which a detailed dynamic model is derived using the Euler-Lagrange approach, yielding a highly coupled, nonlinear state-space representation of the system, affine in the inputs, with the load's position and orientation directly represented by state variables. A zonotopic state estimator is proposed to solve the problem of estimating the load position and orientation, which is formulated based on sensors located at the aircraft, with different sampling times, and unknown-but-bounded measurement noise. To solve the path tracking problem, a discrete-time mixed H-2/H-infinity controller with pole-placement constraints is designed with guaranteed time-response properties and robust to unmodeled dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances. Results from numerical experiments, performed in a platform based on the Gazebo simulator and on a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the system, are presented to corroborate the performance of the zonotopic state estimator along with the designed controller.

The method uses imagery collected by an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), or a consumer drone. The UAS was flown over the area of interest to record video, and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was then applied to analyze the image frames to retrieve the wave celerity. Using the shallow water approximation to the linear-wave dispersion relation, wave celerity from the imagery could be used to deduce the local water depth. After combining the water depth inversion at multiple points from within the area of interest, the bathymetry was constructed. To validate the method, water depths from 25 spatial points were surveyed with a total station during a trial in the nearshore surf zone at Freeport, Texas. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was estimated as 0.132 m. By minimizing the RMSE, the correction factor that accounts for the wave nonlinearity in estimating wave celerity was estimated as 1.02. This new and simple approach provides simultaneous measurement of bathymetry and surface velocity field mainly in the surf zone, where breaking/broken waves and energetic sediment transport frequently dominate, and does not require a high-end UAS, resulting in greater flexibility in sampling across space and time.", "label": "False"}

Ephemeral stream may influence soil properties, which in turn may determine biodiversity and function of an ecosystem in alluvial fan of arid desert region. Ephemeral stream is one of the most common natural disturbances, yet the effects of the ephemeral stream on plant communities in terms of species diversity and plant species distribution remain poorly studied. In this study, the information of species distribution, ephemeral stream beds ('washes'), and the characteristics of plant growth, i.e. height, crown area, were interpreted at different heights using the images of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). After that, soil properties such as soil texture (sand, silt and clay), soil water content, pH, soil organic matter, soil electric conductivity, soil bulk density and the percentage of gravel content, and their relationships with UAV data were assessed in order to explore the influences of ephemeral stream on species diversity, plant growth characteristics and species distribution in an alluvial fan of arid desert region. The results showed that deep-rooted plants were only distributed in washes whereas shallow-rooted plants were distributed in both washes and the outside of washes ('non-washes'). Species richness was significantly higher in washes than that in non-washes whereas the opposite pattern was true for abundance. Soil properties, plant height and crown area were higher in washes than that in non-washes. Plant height, crown area and the total number of individual plants increased with increasing wash width and per unit length of stream flow.

Here we demonstrate the utility of a low cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in measuring two-dimensional running kinematics from free-roaming giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) in the Free State Province, South Africa. We collected 120 Hz video of running giraffes, and calibrated each video frame using metatarsal length as a constant object of scale. We tested a number of methods to measure metatarsal length. The method with the least variation used close range photography and a trigonometric equation to spatially calibrate the still image, and derive metatarsal length. In the absence of this option, a spatially calibrated surface model of the study terrain was used to estimate topographical dimensions in video footage of interest. Data for the terrain models were collected using the same equipment., during the same study period. We subsequently validated the accuracy of the UAV method by comparing similar speed measurements of a human subject running on a treadmill, with treadmill speed. At 8 m focal distance we observed an error of 8% between the two measures of speed. This error was greater at a shorter focal distance, and when the subject was not in the central field of view. We recommend that future users maximise the camera focal distance, and keep the subject in the central field of view. The studied giraffes used a grounded rotary gallop with a speed range of 3.4-6.9 ms(-1) (never cantering, trotting or pacing), and lower duty factors when compared with other cursorial quadrupeds. As this pattern might result in adverse increases in peak vertical limb forces with speed, it was notable to find that contralateral limbs became more in-phase with speed. Considering the latter pattern and the modest maximal speed of giraffes, we speculate that tissue safety factors are maintained within tolerable bounds this way. Furthermore, the angular kinematics of the neck were frequently isolated from the pitching of the body during running; this may be a result of the large mass of the head and neck. Further field experiments and biomechanical models are needed to robustly test these speculations.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Iterative Learning Method for In-Flight Auto-Tuning of UAV Controllers Based on Basic Sensory Information Abstract: Lipid storage droplet-2 (LSD-2) of Drosophila melanogaster is a member of the lipid storage droplet membrane surface-binding protein family. LSD-2 is detected in many specific tissues: germline precursor cells, fat body, and is associated with lipid metabolism, lipid storage, and regulation of lipid droplet transport. However, the roles of this gene in development remain unclear. To investigate these functions, we performed tissue-specific knockdown of Lsd-2 in Drosophila using the combination of GAL4/UAS system and RNAi. Here we report that the knockdown of Lsd-2 in the wing led to abnormal wing phenotype and cell death in the wing pouch of 3rd-instar larvae, suggesting an essential role of Lsd-2 in development of the Drosophila wing. This function of Lsd-2 is dependent on the transcription factor dFoxO, as dFoxO depletion suppresses cell death and the abnormal wing pattern formation induced by Lsd-2-knockdown. Furthermore, Lsd-2-knockdown up-regulated the expression of the dFoxO transcription target reaper, which constitutes a pro-apoptosis gene. This study provides the first evidence that Lsd2-knockdown causes cell death mediated by dfoxO. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "label": "False"}

In this article, we consider a cellular-vehicle-to-anything (C-V2X) application and we propose the integration of an aerial and a terrestrial component of the network, to fill the potential unavailability of short-range connections among vehicles and address unpredictable traffic distribution in space and time. In particular, we envision a UAV with C-V2X equipment providing service for the extended sensing application, and we propose a UAV trajectory design accounting for the radio resource (RR) assignment.

{"text": "Title: Remote Image Capture System to Improve Aerial Supervision for Precision Irrigation in Agriculture Abstract: An important part of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration's (NPRA's) mission is to monitor and react to snow avalanche hazards in steep areas above their roads. Small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) are increasing capable and commercially available. The NPRA wanted to evaluate if this technology could support their avalanche program but had concerns about UASs' ability to function and to provide usable information in typical field conditions. The NPRA hired vendors to fly nine different UAS aircraft on challenging avalanche surveillance missions in cold, windy weather in steep mountains. An evaluation team's conclusions were that different aircraft could be effectively used for different aspects of avalanche monitoring and that cameras on UASs (both visible light and infrared) provided images useful for avalanche surveillance. A second test further evaluated if sensors and cameras carried on UASs could provide NPRA's avalanche staff with usable snow depth, layering, and surface information. Data from UAS carrying visual cameras, used for both real-time viewing and photogrammetry (structure from motion), and ground penetrating radar (GPR) were compared with snow pack information collected using hand dug pits. The review team found the GPR output could identify the weak snow layers that cause avalanches but the raw data required time-consuming post-processing. Photogrammetry had considerable potential as it mapped snow surface conditions and, with a baseline survey, measured snow depth, both of which are valuable for avalanche assessment. Overall, the review team felt UAS technology held considerable promise to support transportation agencies' roadside avalanche monitoring programs.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Dynamics of Outgassing and Plume Transport Revealed by Proximal Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Measurements at Volcan Villarrica, Chile Abstract: Due to the limitations of drones and satellites to obtain aerial images of the crops in real time, the time to flight delay, the problems caused by adverse weather conditions and other issues, the use of fixed cameras placed on the regions of interest is essential to get closer, periodic and on-demand images. Water management in agriculture is one of the most important applications of these images. Top view images of a crop can be processed for determining the percentage of green cover (PGC), and 2D images from different viewing angles can be applied for obtaining 3D models of the crops. In both cases, the obtained data can be managed for calculating several parameters such as crop evapotranspiration, water demand, detection of water deficit and indicators about solute transport of fertilizers in the plant. For this purpose, a remote image capture system has been developed for an application in lettuce crops. The system consists of several capture nodes and a local processing base station which includes image processing algorithms to obtain key features for decision-making in irrigation and harvesting strategies. Placing multiple image capture nodes allows obtaining different observation zones that are representative of the entire crop. The nodes have been designed to have autonomous power supply and wireless connection with the base station. This station carries out irrigation and harvesting decisions using the results of the processing of the images captured by the nodes and the information of other local sensors. The wireless connection is made using the ZigBee communication architecture, supported by XBee hardware. The two main benefits of this choice are its low energy consumption and the long range of the connection.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: On-the-Fly Olive Tree Counting Using a UAS and Cloud Services Abstract: Volcanic gas emissions are intimately linked to the dynamics of magma ascent and outgassing and, on geological time scales, constitute an important source of volatiles to the Earth's atmosphere. Measurements of gas composition and flux are therefore critical to both volcano monitoring and to determining the contribution of volcanoes to global geochemical cycles. However, significant gaps remain in our global inventories of volcanic emissions, (particularly for CO2, which requires proximal sampling of a concentrated plume) for those volcanoes where the near-vent region is hazardous or inaccessible. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) provide a robust and effective solution to proximal sampling of dense volcanic plumes in extreme volcanic environments. Here we present gas compositional data acquired using a gas sensor payload aboard a UAS flown at Volcan Villarrica, Chile. We compare UAS-derived gas time series to simultaneous crater rim multi-GAS data and UV camera imagery to investigate early plume evolution. SO2 concentrations measured in the young proximal plume exhibit periodic variations that are well correlated with the concentrations of other species. By combining molar gas ratios (CO2/SO2=1.48-1.68, H2O/SO2=67-75, and H2O/CO2=45-51) with the SO2 flux (14217t/day) from UV camera images, we derive CO2 and H2O fluxes of 150t/day and 2,850t/day, respectively. We observe good agreement between time-averaged molar gas ratios obtained from simultaneous UAS- and ground-based multi-GAS acquisitions. However, the UAS measurements made in the young, less diluted plume reveal additional short-term periodic structure that reflects active degassing through discrete, audible gas exhalations.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Average Peak Age-of-Information Minimization in UAV-Assisted IoT Networks Abstract: Given a set of demand and potential facility locations and a set of fully available charged drones, an agency seeks to locate a pre-specified number of capacitated facilities and assign drones to the located facilities to serve the demands. The facilities serve as drone launching sites for distributing the resources. Each drone makes several one-to-one trips from the facility location to the demand points and back until the battery range is met. The planning period is short-term and therefore the recharging of drone batteries is not considered. This paper presents an integer linear programming formulation with the objective of maximizing coverage while explicitly incorporating the drone energy consumption and range constraints. The new formulation is called the Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones or simply MCFLPD. The MCFLPD is a complex problem and even for relatively small problem sizes a state of the art MIP solver may require unacceptably long running times to find feasible solutions. Computational efficiency of MCFLPD solutions is a key factor since conditions associated with customer demands or weather conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed) may change suddenly and require a fast global reoptimization. To better balance solution quality and running times novel greedy and three-stage heuristics (3SH) are developed. The 3SH is based on decomposition and local exchange principles and involves a facility location and allocation problem, multiple knapsack subproblems, and a final local random search stage. On average the 3SH solutions are within 5% of the best Gurobi solutions but at a small fraction of the running time. Multiple scenarios are run to highlight the importance of changes in drone battery capabilities on coverage.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Utilizing UAV video data for in-depth analysis of drivers' crash risk at interchange merging areas Abstract: Researchers have proposed the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in humanitarian relief to search for victims in disaster-affected areas. Once UAVs must search through the entire affected area to find victims, the path-planning operation becomes equivalent to an area coverage problem. In this study, we propose an innovative method for solving such problem based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which considers the observations made from UAVs. The formulation of the UAV path planning is based on the idea of assigning higher priorities to the areas that are more likely to have victims. We applied the method to three illustrative cases, considering different types of disasters: a tornado in Brazil, a refugee camp in South Sudan, and a nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan. The results demonstrated that the POMDP solution achieves full coverage of disaster-affected areas within a reasonable time span. We evaluate the traveled distance and the operation duration (which were quite stable), as well as the time required to find groups of victims by a detailed multivariate sensitivity analysis. The comparisons with a Greedy Algorithm showed that the POMDP finds victims more quickly, which is the priority in humanitarian relief, whereas the performance of the Greedy focuses on minimizing the traveled distance. We also discuss the ethical, legal, and social acceptance issues that can influence the application of the proposed methodology in practice.", "label": "False"}

High-level geometric primitives are employed to compactly represent the situation, which includes self-situation of the robot and situation of the obstacles in the environment. A probabilistic graph is utilized to sample the admissible space without taking into account the existing obstacles.

{"text": "Title: Biomimetic Solid-State Zn<SUP>2+</SUP> Electrolyte for Corrugated Structural Batteries Abstract: In order to increase the survivability of the fighter aircraft, the serpentine nozzle has been applied in series of stealth bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles due to its excellent potentiality of evidently suppressing the infrared radiation signatures and radar cross section emitted by engine exhausts. Among the geometric parameters of the serpentine nozzle, the aspect ratio (AR) at the nozzle exit is one of the most critical parameters for the nozzle design as the infrared suppression effect could be greatly enhanced with the increment of AR by strengthening the mixing between the exhaust plume and atmosphere; the aim of this paper is to study the influence of the AR on the flow characteristics of the double serpentine nozzle. The flow features of six double serpentine convergent nozzles, i.e. AR = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15 respectively, were numerically simulated with the shear stress transport kappa-omega turbulent model adopted, which had been validated by the experimental data. The characteristics of internal flow and external jet, and the aerodynamic performances of these six nozzles were compared. Results show that the Ma contours at the symmetric plane are different due to the distinct flow accelerations caused by the change of the curvature and the duct height for diverse AR, and the surface pressure and the shock wave features are different correspondingly. The lateral divergence and the lateral convergence characteristics of the nozzle configuration lead to opposite lateral flow under diverse AR, and the change of lateral width induced different lateral pressure gradient, then lead to various lateral vortex distributions. The length of potential core is the contribution of the comprehensive effects of geometry parameters, and it is decreased with the increase of AR due to the dominated effect of the increased mixing area; however, the declining rate is slowed down. The AR of 5 should be chosen for the best aerodynamic performance of the double serpentine nozzle under the qualifications to completely shield the high-temperature turbine.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: MACHINE LEARNING FOR WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY AND SECURITY OF CELLULAR-CONNECTED UAVS Abstract: In future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based services, UAV fleets will be managed by several independent flight operation service providers in shared low-altitude airspace. Therefore, conflict detection and resolution (CDR) methods that can solve conflicts-possible collisions between UAVs of different service providers-are a key element of the unmanned aircraft system traffic management system. As our CDR method, we introduce an adaptation of ORCA, which is a state-of-the-art collision avoidance algorithm hitherto mainly used in a limited theoretical scope, to realistic UAV operations. Our approach, called adapted ORCA, addresses practical considerations that are inherent to the deployment of UAVs in shared airspace, such as navigation inaccuracies, communication overhead, and flight phases. We validate our approach through simulations. First, by empirically tuning the ORCA parameters look-ahead time window and deconfliction distance, we are able to minimize the ORCA generated deviations from the nominal flight path. Second, by simulating realistic UAV traffic for delivery, we can determine a value for separation distance between UAVs that uses airspace efficiently.", "label": "False"}

At the same time, the industry is affected by various issues, inefficiencies, and externalities, particularly in the last-mile segment. As such, there is an emerging awareness of a need to improve urban mobility and transportation, making them more sustainable and competitive by mixing traditional and emerging technologies, such as cargo bikes, autonomous vehicles, and drones. In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors' business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles.

{"text": "Title: Hot monkey, cold reality: surveying rainforest canopy mammals using drone-mounted thermal infrared sensors Abstract: Exceptional natural phenomena, such as those that occur during a total solar eclipse, provide unique opportunities to study animal behavior outside the naturally evolved context, which can be informative in more general terms. Circumstantial descriptions of abnormal animal behavior during solar eclipses abound, although scientific studies conducted during an eclipse are relatively rare due to inherent logistical difficulties. Here, honey bee foraging and homing behavior were studied during the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. In the first experiment, we studied foraging behavior of honey bees during the progression of the solar eclipse and found that the foraging activity drastically decreased but did not completely cease during the totality of the eclipse, in contrast to previous reports of complete cessation. The data indicate that the level of ambient light can largely overrule the internal circadian rhythm of foraging honey bees. Furthermore, colonies with a higher need for foraging decreased their foraging activity less than satiated colonies, consistent with the hypothesis that individual foraging decisions may be influenced by colony state, which affects cost-benefit analyses. In a second experiment, the temporal dynamics of homing of released workers and drones was compared in periods before, during, and after the solar eclipse. During the totality of the eclipse, very few bees arrived back at their hive, while homing before the total eclipse was accelerated, particularly in drones. The results suggest that, while the homing abilities of honey bees are not compromised until the sun is completely eclipsed, they may still interpret the diminishing light as an indicator of deteriorating flight conditions. Our unique study provides some insight into the control of honey bee foraging behavior when external cues and internal circadian rhythms are at odds, lent support to the notion that food deprivation can lead to riskier foraging, and indicated that homing in honey bees is possible even with very small amounts of sunlight.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: The View from Above: A Survey of the Public's Perception of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Privacy Abstract: Animals of the rainforest canopies are often endangered by deforestation or hunting but are difficult to survey and study because of the inaccessibility of the treetops, combined with the visual camouflage of many species. Drone-based thermal sensors have the potential to overcome these hurdles by rapidly scanning large forested areas from above, detecting and mapping wildlife based on the contrast between their warm body temperatures and the cool tree canopies. We tested this concept by flying a drone-mounted thermal infrared radiometric sensor over the wildlife-rich rainforests of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Arboreal mammals had body temperatures around 27 degrees C and were conspicuous in the thermal infrared imagery at night and early morning when the forest canopy was cool (23-25 degrees C), but were difficult to detect by mid-morning, by which time the direct sunshine had heated up canopy vegetation to over 30 degrees C. Species were difficult to identify from thermal infrared imagery alone, but could be recognized from synchronized visual images taken during the daytime. Simultaneous drone and ground-based surveys of the same area proved that the aerial thermal camera did detect high-canopy species missed by the terrestrial observer, but that substantially more animals were detected by the human than by the drone. Because animal detection was so much better at night, when species ID was difficult, we suggest that future work could combine automated detection of animals from thermal infrared imagery with flash photography or IR illumination to enable species ID during nocturnal surveys. We conclude by discussing various logistical challenges that limit the utility of drone-based thermal infrared today, but that could be overcome by continued improvement of technology and collaboration with permitting agencies.", "label": "False"}

Approximately one million new UAVs have been registered in the United States, with the majority being recreational UAVs. This growth of UAV activity and their increasingly common public presence engenders a wide variety of opinions, perceptions, and concerns among individuals about UAVs, particularly concerning personal privacy. Drawing from the privacy and emerging technology literature, the purpose of this paper is to identify how individuals' perceptions of privacy explain their attitudes on the use of UAVs and whether this aligns with what we would expect from an emerging technology. Utilizing Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for survey delivery to 2,108 respondents we conducted a descriptive statistical analysis of response frequency and t-tests of group mean differences. The results suggest that individuals who use UAVs, maintain a familiarity with the capabilities of UAVs, and have a basic understanding of UAV regulations, are somewhat less concerned about the growing presence of UAVs as it relates to privacy than individuals who are generally unfamiliar with UAVs, their capabilities, and UAV regulations.

In this paper, we consider a network that comprises multiple flying UAVs and GSs to transfer messages by multi-hop relaying. We propose a routing protocol, named course-aware opportunistic routing for FANETs (CORF). The UAVs cooperatively exchange aeronautical data with others. The source UAV node (SUN) calculates the transfer probabilities to different neighbors by jointly considering the positions of its neighbors and the destination node. Based on the direction information and the transfer probabilities, the SUN selects the next-hop relay nodes among the neighbor UAVs and GSs. This process continues until the destination node receives the message. The simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed CORF protocol achieves significant performance superiority as compared with the traditional protocols in terms of message delivery rate and network latency.", "label": "False"}

Despite this, a number of discoveries have occurred mainly during the past two decades. These include emeralds from Northwest Territories (1997) and Yukon (1998); sapphire (2002) and spinel (from 1982)-including cobalt-blue stones-from Baffin Island in Nunavut; and ruby and pink sapphire (2002) from British Columbia. Such discoveries can be assisted by undertaking scientific research into gem formation, as well as by applying exploration criteria developed elsewhere to uncharted territory. Future exploration in Canada and other countries facing similar challenges will likely benefit from additional geological studies to identity prospective areas and features; innovative means of transportation, such as boats instead of aircraft, drones for exploring rugged terrain; hyperspectral imaging for mineral sensing; surveying with UV lamps to identify minerals associated with gem mineralisation; and careful prospecting (including field mapping and collecting heavy mineral concentrates) by experienced individuals.

The MTC has become the main communication paradigm for several emerging smart services, such as public safety, health care, industrial automation, drones/robotics, utilities, and transportation. The MTC requires a major model change to cope with the improvement in 5G and imposes various requirements on the enabling technology, such as ultra-reliability, low latency, and availability. The scheme that fulfills such requirements are called a mission-critical MTC (mcMTC). However, the mcMTC is still in the early-standardization phase of 5G new radio and it needs a lot of research efforts to be improved.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted as a modulation scheme for this communication system to combat fading. Unfortunately, because of possible high UGV speed, the orthogonality between subcarriers in OFDM signals is prone to intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by the Doppler spread. This paper discusses ICI suppression analysis using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 under several Harbor transmission scenarios. Such communication links may contain line of sight (LoS) components in transmission. The channel is thus modeled as the well-known fast time varying path loss model. Furthermore, this paper derives the signal to interference ratio (SIR) and evaluates this parameter for several types of fading and Doppler spread shapes in UGV channels. Additionally, the paper presents a practical method for calculating the spectral efficiency of OFDM systems, with an example for actual implementation in UGV systems. Eventually, the testbed results indicate that the SIR will decrease if the maximum Doppler spread expands. In the Rician channel, it can be seen that the SIR depends on the maximum Doppler speed, the angle of arrival (AoA), and even the Rician element of the LoS component.", "label": "False"}

Their lower cost compared to current fixed location camera systems or Manned Aerial Vehicles (MAV) and their ability to read just their view area depending on the situation they face, make them a promising tool of collecting both macroscopic and microscopic data. However, although drone technology and computer vision techniques are advancing fast, there is little information on how accurate and reliable they are for collecting microscopic traffic data. In this paper, we examine the potential of using sUAV as part of the ITS infrastructure as a way of extracting naturalistic trajectory data from aerial video footage from a low volume four-way intersection and a pedestrian passage. Moreover, the accuracy of speed data collected from a drone compared to data collected from an On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) device is examined. For this, a controlled experiment where the vehicle was driven in various speeds and the drone flew in ranging altitudes was conducted.

The design of the controller is simple; it is based on the minimization of the one-step-ahead predicted position errors. The stability analysis of the closed loop in the presence of external disturbances is presented. The analysis results prove that the tracking errors of attitude, take-off, hovering, and landing are uniformly bounded. Since the proposed control algorithm will be employed for goods delivery by drones, the robustness of this algorithm against low-frequency disturbances and payload variations is a major objective. To this end, integral action is included in the altitude loop to eliminate the induced steady-state error and to drop off the payload in the desired position successfully.

{"text": "Title: The Broadcast Storm Problem in FANETs and the Dynamic Neighborhood-Based Algorithm as a Countermeasure Abstract: With the recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the development of energy-efficient networking technology for mission-oriented multiple cooperative UAVs has become crucial. Routing in flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) with UAVs is a challenging issue because of the high speed and sudden changes in direction of UAVs. Traditional routing protocols in FANETs periodically send hello messages for the establishment and maintenance of the routes. However, sending hello messages periodically after a fixed interval increases bandwidth wastage when the hello interval is excessively short or causes long delays in neighbour discovery when the hello interval is overly long. Moreover, several disconnected UAV groups have been observed in which the group members are connected among themselves but detached from the main network. By exchanging excessive hello messages inside the group, the UAVs maintain an unnecessary neighbourhood, causing wastage of energy. However, FANETs have certain advantages, such as knowledge about mission-related information. To solve the problem of unnecessary energy drain, we propose a novel adaptive hello interval scheme of energy efficient hello (EE-Hello)-based on available mission-related information, such as the volume of the allowed airspace, number of UAVs, UAV-transmission range, and UAV speed. We present a method to decide the distance that a UAV needs to travel before sending a hello message. We also specify a technique to determine the number of UAVs necessary to achieve specific network requirements, such as packet delivery ratio or throughput, with the expenditure of minimum energy. We show that the proposed EE-Hello can save about 25% of the energy currently used, by suppressing unnecessary hello messages without degrading the overall network throughput.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Hybrid Self-Organized Clustering Scheme for Drone Based Cognitive Internet of Things Abstract: Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) are a new paradigm that can overcome mission constraints of single unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). FANETs are composed of several UAVs that cooperate to accomplish some critical mission (i.e., hazardous area monitoring). In order to maintain UAVs coordination, all UAVs must continuously retransmit or relay messages through the wireless channel to assure that every UAV knows the FANET condition. However, when this message exchange is done arbitrarily, it may cause the broadcast storm problem, leading the wireless medium to an inoperable state. Despite some efforts reported in the literature for providing general broadcast storm problem mitigation techniques, the challenge of aggregating new information/knowledge to receivers, instead of just spreading the information in the network, has received less attention. In this paper, we not only prove that broadcast storm problem causes network contention as the number of UAVs increases but also propose the innovative dynamic neighborhood-based algorithm for the broadcast storm problem (DNA-BSP), which was developed and validated based on the outdoor experiments and computer simulations. It can mitigate the broadcast storm problem, which is a real challenge in FANETs, reducing message redundancy in more than 98%, and making message delivery more than 95% faster than in flooding scenario, outperforming classical broadcast storm mitigation techniques when applied in FANETs.

Optimal use of UAVs in dynamic environments is important in many aspects, e.g., increasing efficacy and reducing the air traffic, resulting in a safer environment, and it requires new techniques and robust approaches based on the capabilities of UAVs and constraints. This paper analyzes several delivery schemes within a platform, such as delivery with and without using air highways and delivery using a hybrid scheme along with several delivery methods (i.e., optimal, premium, and first-in first-out) to explore the use of UAV swarms as part of the logistics operations. In this platform, a dimension reduction technique, \"dynamic multiple assignments in multidimensional space,\" and several other new techniques along with Hungarian and cross-entropy Monte Carlo techniques are forged together to assign tasks and plan 3D routes dynamically. This particular approach is performed in such a way that UAV swarms in several warehouses are deployed optimally given the delivery scheme, method, and constraints. Several scenarios are tested on the simulator using small and big data sets. The results show that the distribution and the characteristics of data sets and constraints affect the decision on choosing the optimal delivery scheme and the method. The findings are expected to guide the aviation authorities in their decisions before dictating rules and regulations regarding effective, efficient, and safe use of UAVs. Furthermore, the companies that produce UAVs are going to take the demonstrated results into account for their functional design of UAVs along with other companies that aim to deliver their products using UAVs.

The Lazy Theta* path-planning algorithm is revisited and adapted to generate paths fast enough to be used in real time and outdoors in large 3D scenarios. In real unknown scenarios, a given minimum safety distance to the nearest obstacle or unknown space should be observed, increasing the associated obstacle detection queries, and creating a bottleneck in the path-planning algorithm. We have reduced the dimension of the problem by considering geometrical properties to speed up these computations. On the other hand, we have also applied a non-regular grid representation of the world to increase the performance of the path-planning algorithm. In particular, a sparse resolution grid in the form of an octree is used, organizing the measurements spatially, merging voxels when they are of the same state.

Moreover, an approach to determine the gain matrices of the formation-containment protocol is proposed by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Finally, a formation-containment platform with five quadrotor UAVs is introduced, and both the simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. Note to Practitioners-This paper addresses the problem of formation-containment control for multi-UAV systems over directed topologies. In practical applications, there may exist multiple leaders and multiple followers in a multi-UAV system. Formation-containment means that the states of leaders form the desired time-varying formation and at the same time the states of the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm, which supports the cooperation of a ground vehicle and multiple UAVs for efficient parcel delivery. Our routing and scheduling algorithm allows multiple UAVs carried by the vehicle to simultaneously deliver multiple parcels to customers residing in different locations. The proposed algorithm consists of a pipeline of several modules: population management, heuristic population initialization, and population education.

{"text": "Title: Convolutional Neural Network-Based Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking for Parrot AR Drone 2 Abstract: In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are making a revolution as an emerging technology with many different applications in the military, civilian, and commercial fields. The advent of autonomous drones has initiated serious challenges, including how to maintain their safe operation during their missions. The safe operation of UAVs remains an open and sensitive issue since any unexpected behavior of the drone or any hazard would lead to potential risks that might be very severe. The motivation behind this work is to propose a methodology for the safety assurance of drones over the Internet (Internet of drones (IoD)). Two approaches will be used in performing the safety analysis: (1) a qualitative safety analysis approach and (2) a quantitative safety analysis approach. The first approach uses the international safety standards, namely, ISO 12100 and ISO 13849 to assess the safety of drone's missions by focusing on qualitative assessment techniques. The methodology starts with hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and finally draws the safety recommendations associated with a drone delivery use case. The second approach presents a method for the quantitative safety assessment using Bayesian networks (BN) for probabilistic modeling. BN utilizes the information provided by the first approach to model the safety risks related to UAVs' flights. An illustrative UAV crash scenario is presented as a case study, followed by scenario analysis, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. These two analyses, qualitative and quantitative, enable all involved stakeholders to detect, explore, and address the risks of UAV flights, which will help the industry to better manage the safety concerns of UAVs.", "label": "False"}

Edge computing offers promising solutions for addressing these requirements because of several features, such as geo-distribution, mobility, low latency, heterogeneity, and support for real-time interactions. To employ network edges, existing fixed roadside units can be equipped with edge computing servers. Nevertheless, there are situations where additional infrastructure units are required to handle temporary high traffic loads during public events, unexpected weather conditions, or extreme traffic congestion. In such cases, the use of flying roadside units are carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which provide the required infrastructure for supporting traffic applications and improving the quality of service. UAVs can be dynamically deployed to act as mobile edges in accordance with traffic events and congestion conditions. The key benefits of this dynamic approach include: 1) the potential for characterizing the environmental requirements online and performing the deployment accordingly, and 2) the ability to move to another location when necessary.

In such a trend, detecting vehicles and extracting traffic parameters from UAV video in a fast and accurate manner is becoming crucial in many prospective applications. However, from the methodological perspective, several limitations have to be addressed before the actual implementation of UAV. This paper proposes a new and complete analysis framework for traffic flow parameter estimation from UAV video. This framework addresses the well-concerned issues on UAV's irregular ego-motion, low estimation accuracy in dense traffic situation, and high computational complexity by designing and integrating four stages. In the first two stages an ensemble classifier (Haar cascade + convolutional neural network) is developed for vehicle detection, and in the last two stages a robust traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on optical flow and traffic flow theory. The proposed ensemble classifier is demonstrated to outperform the state-of-the-art vehicle detectors that designed for UAV-based vehicle detection.

Although A-star algorithm is usually used to solve this problem due to its fast computational time, it may suffer from some drawbacks, for instance, there are too many unnecessary inflection points and redundant nodes during its moving process. For this reason, the improved A-star algorithm is proposed to optimize the motion path, including the reduction of path length, number of AGV turns and path planning time. In this scheme, a key point selection strategy is used for the secondary planning based on the initial path obtained by the A-Star algorithm. Therefore, redundant inflection points and nodes in the path can be effectively removed. Additionally, the rotation direction and rotation angle of AGV at the inflection point can be thus determined. This improved A-star method can provide a more efficient path planning with shorter routes, less turn times and shorter operation time compared with previous methods, such as the A-star algorithm and the ant colony algorithm.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Integration of terrestrial laser scanning and soil sensors for deformation and hydrothermal monitoring of frost mounds Abstract: Designing a building for polar stations involves countless cost-benefit trade-offs. One critical decision for planners is whether to elevate structures or place them on the snow surface. For planners wishing to minimize the impact of drifting, elevated structures are generally more desirable, with the tradeoff of added construction cost. Surface-based structures are less expensive to construct, but accumulate drift more rapidly than their elevated counterparts, thus incurring an added recurring expense of snow removal. To estimate this added cost, we quantified the volume of snow drifted on several structures at Summit, Greenland, using structure-frommotion photogrammetry from a small UAV. We find that while the elevated \"Bighouse\" accumulated negligible drift, the surface-based \"Greenhouse\" accumulated 4862 +/- 444 m (3) of snow. We then use estimates of equipment efficiency at snow removal coupled with equipment operating cost to determine the time and cost of snow removal (69 +/- 6 h for the Greenhouse). Finally, we analyze a 10-year record of winds from Summit, and estimate the total amount of snow drifted on the structures in any given year. We estimate that the Greenhouse at Summit accumulates an average of 11,702 m (3) of snow per year, and that clearing that snow costs an average of $41,000 per year. The expense of snow removal for surface-based structures should be factored into the total lifetime cost of the building, making elevated structures much more cost-competitive than they may initially appear.", "label": "False"}

The QTEC is classified as a critical engineering and transportation corridor and is connected to both inland China and the Tibetan Plateau. The engineering infrastructures over the QTEC are distributed around two slopes. A high-accuracy FARO Focus3D X130 3D laser scanner, nine Trimble 5700 GNSS systems and a DJI Inspire 1 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system were used to generate a 3D surface model for the slopes. The deployment of the GNSS datum points (GDPs), GNSS control points (GCPs), a reference sphere set and a set of rectangular white-black cardboards used as registration reference targets (RRTs) enhanced the capacity for data collection, registration and preprocessing of the TLS point cloud. The mapping changes of the slopes based on the TLS data were used to examine the 3D surface topography dynamics during different time periods. Soil temperature and moisture sensors were also adopted to monitor the water and heat exchange for one of the slopes, which can reveal the effects of the hydrothermal process on slope deformation during freeze-thaw cycles. This occurred mainly because the phase transitions initiated slope deformation due to water and heat transfer. The two slopes exhibited mainly thaw slumping during thawing periods and frost heaving during the freezing period, but the frost heaving was dominant after several freeze-thaw cycles. The implementation of TLS and hydrothermal measurement technologies allow for a better understanding and assessment of hazards related to slopes adjacent to engineering and transportation corridors, and this will provide guidance for the future of highway and high-speed railway design and construction along the QTEC.

{"text": "Title: How can statistical and artificial intelligence approaches predict piping erosion susceptibility? Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in fuel cell implementation on aircraft, particularly for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) propulsion. The performance of both fuel cell types, cathode air-breathing H-2 Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC/H-2) and passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs), is dependent on atmospheric conditions such as pressure, relative humidity and temperature. In this study, models at the single-cell level have been used to simulate the corresponding polarization curves on flight conditions, which constitutes a contribution to the use of fuel cells in UAV. After validating these models, several cases of interest relating to UAV operation have been considered, such as cruise flight at different altitudes and horizontal flight when crossing clouds, to compare the performance of both types of fuel cells. Fuel cell temperature has been controlled to avoid high performance degradation. The results show that the effects of atmospheric flight conditions are more important for PEMFC/H-2 than for DMFCs. Low pressure affects PEMFC/H-2 performance to a greater extent than DMFC performance. Atmospheric relative humidity affects PEMFC/H-2 performance, especially at high cell temperatures, whereas DMFC performance is barely affected. Although performance is lost, it is possible to operate fuel cells in UAV propulsion systems at low-medium altitudes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "label": "False"}

{"text": "Title: Analysis of the Differential Update Method for Control Information Dissemination in Wireless Networks Abstract: In the value chain, yields are key information for both growers and other stakeholders in market supply and exports. However, orchard yields are often still based on an extrapolation of tree production which is visually assessed on a limited number of trees; a tedious and inaccurate task that gives no yield information at a finer scale than the orchard plot. In this work, we propose a method to accurately map individual tree production at the orchard scale by developing a trade-off methodology between mechanistic yield modelling and extensive fruit counting using machine vision systems. A methodological toolbox was developed and tested to estimate and map tree species, structure, and yields in mango orchards of various cropping systems (from monocultivar to plurispecific orchards) in the Niayes region, West Senegal. Tree structure parameters (height, crown area and volume), species, and mango cultivars were measured using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and geographic, object-based image analysis. This procedure reached an average overall accuracy of 0.89 for classifying tree species and mango cultivars. Tree structure parameters combined with a fruit load index, which takes into account year and management effects, were implemented in predictive production models of three mango cultivars. Models reached satisfying accuracies with R-2 greater than 0.77 and RMSE% ranging from 20% to 29% when evaluated with the measured production of 60 validation trees. In 2017, this methodology was applied to 15 orchards overflown by UAV, and estimated yields were compared to those measured by the growers for six of them, showing the proper efficiency of our technology. The proposed method achieved the breakthrough of rapidly and precisely mapping mango yields without detecting fruits from ground imagery, but rather, by linking yields with tree structural parameters. Such a tool will provide growers with accurate yield estimations at the orchard scale, and will permit them to study the parameters that drive yield heterogeneity within and between orchards.", "label": "False"}

Flights reported here were conducted 10 to 15 m above ground level (AGL) at the Leach Airfield in the San Luis Valley, Colorado as part of the Lower Atmospheric Process Studies at Elevation-a Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Team Experiment (LAPSE-RATE) campaign in 2018. The ultrasonic anemometers were used to collect simultaneous measurements of wind speed, wind direction, and temperature in a fixed triangle pattern; each sensor was located at one apex of a triangle with similar to 100 to 200 m on each side, depending on the experiment.

Thus, most edge users can obtain their required video files from the caches at users nearby, instead from the small-cell base station.

The concentrations of most ions on the above ground level were higher than that on the ground surface during the sampling period. The measurements of the total ion concentrations were approximately 54 to 26% of the PM2.5 mass concentrations on the ground surface. The concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- decreased with increases in the height from the ground, which may be related to the influence of the vehicle emissions and human activities. NO2- and SO42- both had a peak concentration on the higher vertical altitude at night in the sea-land wind system. In the southern wind system, the emissions of sea salts, dust, and stationary pollution, might be transported by the regional prevailing airflow from the southern coastal area, were the major pollutant sources above the boundary layer. The vertical distribution of ionic concentrations and wind field provided information concerning changes in pollutant transport and source regions that affect the local air quality.

The proposed framework is tailored for characterization of access diversity mechanisms, for example, multi-connectivity or hybrid access methods, which are expected to be essential for ultra-reliable wireless communications in 4G and 5G networks. An active-probe measurement approach is adopted, consisting of a client that transmits timestamped packets to a server, and vice versa, via one or multiple communication links under test The setup allows us to measure the one-way latency performance in uplink and downlink separately, and allows fully synchronized measurements of multiple links in parallel to understand the benefits of multi-connectivity mechanisms. Traffic generation is flexible in terms of packet size, transport protocol (TCP or UDP), and inter-arrival time interval of the generated packets, hence being a powerful tool for benchmarking the performance for different application-specific message flows.

One of the considerable applications of target detection is the safe landing of UAV to the drone station for battery charging and its maintenance. For this, vision-based target detection methods are utilized. Generally, high-cost cameras and expensive CPU's were used for target detection. With the recent development of Raspberry Pi (RPi), it is possible to use the embedded system with cheap price for such applications. In the current research, RPi based drone target detection and safe landing system are proposed with the integration of PID controller for target detection, and Fuzzy Logic controller for safe landing. The proposed system is equipped with a USB camera which is connected to RPi for detecting the target and a laser rangefinder (LIDAR) for measuring the distance for safe landing. To verify the performance of the developed system, a practical test bench based on a quadcopter and a target drone station is developed. Several experiments were conducted under different scenarios.

{"text": "Title: Decentralized planning and control for UAV-UGV cooperative teams Abstract: When a volcano erupts, molten rocks, ash, pyroclastic flow, and debris flow can cause disasters. Debris flow is responsible for enormous damage across large areas. This makes debris flow simulations a crucial means of determining whether to issue an evacuation warning for area residents. For safety purposes, restricted areas are designated around volcanos during eruptions, making it difficult to gather information (such as the amount and permeability of ash) required for precise debris flow simulations. An unmanned observation system, intended for use in such restricted areas, was developed to address this issue. The proposed system is based on a multirotor micro-unmanned aerial vehicle (MUAV) that transports cameras, small devices to measure target environments, and a small robot to active volcanic areas. Several field tests were performed around active volcanoes for validation and system improvement. This study investigates five unmanned systems with field tests. The first one is an autonomous flight to collect three-dimensional (3D) terrain information. The MUAV conducted the long flight at Mt. Unzen-Fugen and evaluated the accuracy and calculation time of the developed 3D terrain model. The second one is a drop-down-type ash-depth measurement scale. The scales were deployed at Mt. Unzen-Fugen and confirmed its function. The third system is a soil-sampling device to estimate permeability. The device is hung from the MUAV by a long tether and collects soil and gravels directly with two rollers, while the MUAV is hovering. Indoor experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the device, and field experiments were conducted to confirm the validation of the system in different volcanic environments. The fourth system is an unmanned surface flow measurement device to estimate permeability. The device carries a water balloon and breaks it when it lands on the ground. By observing water flow with mounted cameras, qualitative permeability can be estimated. Initial experiments were conducted at Mt. Unzen-Fugen to confirm its function. The fifth system is a small ground vehicle with a rainfall sensor deployed by an MUAV. The MUAV carries a capturing net suspended from it and delivers and retrieves the ground vehicle, while it is hovering. Field experiments were conducted at Mt. Asama and Mt. Unzen-Fugen to validate the function of the system. Data obtained by these systems can contribute to the improvement of debris flow simulations developed in the project. In this paper, the above systems and experiments to evaluate them are introduced, and debris flow simulation results are demonstrated to prove the effectiveness of the data obtained by the proposed systems.

{"text": "Title: Application of virtual flight test framework with derivative design optimization Abstract: The aerial manipulators (AMs) are a new class of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) that are created in response to the ever-increasing demand for autonomous object transportation and manipulation. Because of power supply restrictions, the load carrying capacity is limited and therefore it is necessary to reduce the overall weight of these UASs. The past works in the field of AMs consider the multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as the base and manipulators with rigid links as the interactive elements with the environment which are bulky and heavy. To overcome the issue, this paper introduces the AMs endowed with flexible manipulators, their dynamic modeling, a new method for trajectory planning and control algorithm such that the unfavorable effects of using flexible elements like vibrations are minimized. Due to lack of kinematic constraints and the presence of flexibility conditions, conventional methods of trajectory planning for ground wheeled-mobile manipulators (GWMMs) such as extended and augmented Jacobian matrix cannot be applied to AMs. The addition of flexibility to the manipulator increases underactuation degrees (UADs), the complexity of trajectory planning and control synthesis. Considering large deformation assumption for flexible links, the dynamic equations and their induced nonholonomic constraints are derived applying Lagrangian formulation. Then, these constraints with that part of equations of motion corresponding to the links flexibility are solved simultaneously in the context of an optimization algorithm resulting in optimized trajectories. Through simulation results, the proposed method of trajectory planning and vibration control of underactuated flexible AMs has been shown to be effective.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Toward Implementation of Mosquito Sterile Insect Technique: The Effect of Storage Conditions on Survival of Male Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) During Transport Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is a development of a virtual flight test framework with derivative design optimization. Aircraft manufactures and engineers have been putting significant effort into the design process to lower the cost of development and time to a minimum. In terms of flight tests and aircraft certification, implementing simulation and virtual test techniques may be a sufficient method in achieving these goals. In addition to simulation and virtual test, a derivative design can be implemented to satisfy different market demands and technical changes while reducing development cost and time. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a derivative design optimization was applied to Expedition 350, a small piston engine powered aircraft developed by Found Aircraft in Canada. A derivative that changes the manned aircraft to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for payload delivery was considered. An optimum configuration was obtained while enhancing the endurance of the UAV. The multidisciplinary design optimization module of the framework represents the optimized configuration and additional parameters for the simulator. These values were implemented in the simulator and generated the aircraft model for simulation. Two aircraft models were generated for the flight test. Findings - The optimization process delivered the UAV derivative of Expedition E350, and it had increased endurance up to 21.7 hours. The original and optimized models were implemented into virtual flight test. The cruise performance exhibited less than 10 per cent error on cruise performance between the original model and Pilots Operating Handbook (POH). The dynamic stability of original and optimized models was tested by checking Phugoid, short period, Dutch roll and spiral roll modes. Both models exhibited stable dynamic stability characteristics. Practical implications - The original Expedition 350 was generated to verify the accuracy of the simulation data by comparing its result with actual flight test data. The optimized model was generated to evaluate the optimization results. Ultimately, the virtual flight test framework with an aircraft derivative design was proposed in this research. The additional module for derivative design optimization was developed and its results were implemented to commercial off-the-shelf simulators.

{"text": "Title: Electrophysiological Recording of The Central Nervous System Activity of Third-Instar Drosophila Melanogaster Abstract: Sterile insect technique (SIT) is a promising, environmentally friendly alternative to the use of pesticides for insect pest control. However, implementing SIT with Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) mosquitoes presents unique challenges. For example, during transport from the rearing facility to the release site and during the actual release in the field, damage to male mosquitoes should be minimized to preserve their reproductive competitiveness. The short flight range of male Ae. aegypti requires elaborate release strategies such as release via Unmanned Aircraft Systems, more commonly referred to as drones. Two key parameters during transport and release are storage temperature and compaction rate. We performed a set of laboratory experiments to identify the optimal temperatures and compaction rates for storage and transport of male Ae. aegypti. We then conducted shipping experiments to test our laboratory-derived results in a 'real-life' setting. The laboratory results indicate that male Ae. aegypti can survive at a broad range of storage temperatures ranging from 7 to 28 degrees C, but storage time should not exceed 24 h. Male survival was high at all compaction rates we tested with a low at 40 males/cm(3). Interestingly, results from our 'real-life' shipping experiment showed that high compaction rates were beneficial to survival. This study advances key understudied aspects of the practicalities of moving lab-reared insects into the field and lies the foundation for further studies on the effect of transport conditions on male reproductive fitness.", "label": "False"}
{"text": "Title: Cooperative aerial lift and manipulation (CALM) Abstract: This paper discusses the conceptual design and proof-of-concept flight demonstration of a novel variable pitch quadrotor biplane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle concept for payload delivery. The proposed design combines vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), precise hover capabilities of a quadrotor helicopter and high range, endurance and high forward cruise speed characteristics of a fixed wing aircraft. The proposed methodology is described by taking an example of a VTOL Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for a mission requirement of carrying and delivering 6 kg payload to a destination at 16 km from the point of origin. First, the design of proprotors is carried out using a physics based modified Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) analysis, which is validated using experimental data generated for the purpose. Proprotors have conflicting requirement for optimal hover and forward flight performance and a compromise solution has to be chosen. Next, the biplane wings are designed using simple lifting line theory. The airframe design is followed by power plant selection and transmission design. Finally, weight estimation is carried out to complete the design process. The proprotor design with 24 degrees preset angle and -24 degrees twist is found to be suitable for the current mission profile, based on 70% weightage to forward flight and 30% weightage to hovering flight conditions. A reduction in operating RPM of the proprotors from 3200 during hover to 2000 during forward flight results in 27% increase in proprotor efficiency. The VTOL UAV design proposed in this paper is also predicted to consume 64% less power in airplane mode compared to the quadrotor mode, thereby establishing the benefit of this hybrid concept.

{"text": "Title: DroneNetX: Network Reconstruction Through Connectivity Probing and Relay Deployment by Multiple UAVs in Ad Hoc Networks Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for aerial payload transport and object manipulation by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) team. This new paradigm, called cooperative payload lift and manipulation (CALM), applies the continuum deformation agent coordination approach to transport and manipulate objects autonomously with collision avoidance guarantees. CALM treats UAVs as moving supports during transport and as stationary supports during object manipulation. Constraints are formulated to assure sufficient thrust forces are available to maintain stability and follow prescribed motion and force/torque profiles. CALM uses tensegrity muscles to carry a suspended payload or a manipulation object rather than cables. A tensegrity structure is lightweight and can carry both the tension and compression forces required during cooperative manipulation. During payload transport, UAVs are categorized as leaders and followers. Leaders define continuum deformation shape and motion profile while followers coordinate through local communication. Each UAV applies input-output (10) feedback linearization control to track the trajectory defined by continuum deformation. For object manipulation, the paper proposes a new hybrid force controller to stabilize quadcopters when smooth or sudden (impulsive) forces and moments are exerted on the system.

{"text": "Title: Assessment of Aquatic Weed in Irrigation Channels Using UAV and Satellite Imagery Abstract: Drones have recently become extremely popular, especially in military and civilian applications. Examples of drone utilization include reconnaissance, surveillance, and packet delivery. As time has passed, drones' tasks have become larger and more complex. As a result, swarms or clusters of drones are preferred, because they offer more coverage, flexibility, and reliability. However, drone systems have limited computing power and energy resources, which means that sometimes it is difficult for drones to finish their tasks on schedule. A solution to this is required so that drone clusters can complete their work faster. One possible solution is an offloading scheme between drone clusters. In this study, we propose an opportunistic computational offloading system, which allows for a drone cluster with a high intensity task to borrow computing resources opportunistically from other nearby drone clusters. We design an artificial neural network-based response time prediction module for deciding whether it is faster to finish tasks by offloading them to other drone clusters. The offloading scheme is conducted only if the predicted offloading response time is smaller than the local computing time. Through simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme can decrease the response time of drone clusters through an opportunistic offloading process.", "label": "False"}

A combination of unsupervised and supervised classification methods is used to allow semi-automatic training of a new classifier for each new image, improving robustness and efficiency. The accuracy of classification algorithms with various band combinations and spatial resolutions is investigated. With three classes (water, land and weed), good accuracy (typical validation kappa >0.9) was achieved with classification and regression tree (CART) classifier; red, green, blue and near-infrared (RGBN) bands; and resolutions better than 1 m.

In this work 29 rotary and fixed-wing UAV surveys were conducted during multiple field campaigns, totaling 47 flights and over 14.3 km(2), to document permafrost thaw subsidence impacts on or close to road infrastructure in the Northwest Territories, Canada. This paper provides four case studies: (1) terrain models and orthomosaic time series revealed the morphology and daily to annual dynamics of thaw-driven mass wasting phenomenon (retrogressive thaw slumps; RTS). Scar zone cut volume estimates ranged between 3.2 x 10(3) and 5.9 x 10(6) m(3). The annual net erosion of RTS surveyed ranged between 0.35 x 10(3) and 0.39 x 10(6) m(3). The largest RTS produced a long debris tongue with an estimated volume of 1.9 x 10(6) m(3). Downslope transport of scar zone and embankment fill materials was visualized using flow vectors, while thermal imaging revealed areas of exposed ground ice and mobile lobes of saturated, thawed materials. (2) Stratigraphic models were developed for RTS headwalls, delineating ground-ice bodies and stratigraphic unconformities. (3) In poorly drained areas along road embankments, UAV surveys detected seasonal terrain uplift and settlement of up to 0.5 m (>1700 m(2) in extent) as a result of injection ice development. (4) Time series of terrain models highlighted the thaw-driven evolution of a borrow pit (6.4 x 10(5) m(3) cut volume) constructed in permafrost terrain, whereby fluvial and thaw-driven sediment transfer (1.1 and 3.9 x 10(3) m(3) a(-1) respectively) was observed and annual slope profile reconfiguration was monitored to gain management insights concerning site stabilization. Elevation model vertical accuracies were also assessed as part of the case studies and ranged between 0.02 and 0.13 m Root Mean Square Error. Photogrammetric models processed with Post-processed Kinematic image solutions achieved similar accuracies without ground control points over much larger and complex areas than previously reported. The high resolution of UAV surveys, and the capacity to derive quantitative time series provides novel insights into permafrost processes that are otherwise challenging to study.

During the event, large amounts of wood clogged and damaged a bridge of a cycling path at the outlet of the Grimmbach, while the town of Braunsbach was devastated by discharge and material transported along the Orlacher Bach. The severity of the event in these two small catchments (30.0 km(2) and 5.95 km(2), respectively) is remarkable in basins with a relatively low average slope (10.7 and 12.0%, respectively). In order to gain a better understanding of the driving forces during this flood event an integrated approach was applied including (i) an estimate of peak discharges, (ii) an analysis of changes in channel width by comparing available aerial photographs before the flood with a post-flood aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and validation with field observations, (iii) a detailed mapping of landslides and analysis of their connectivity with the channel network and finally (iv) an analysis of the amounts of large wood recruited and deposited in the channel. The morphological changes in the channels can be explained by hydraulic parameters, such as stream power and unit stream power, and by morphological parameters such as the valley confinement. This is similar for LW recruitment amounts and volume of exported LW since most of it comes from the erosion of the valley floor. The morphological changes and large wood recruitment and deposit are in the range of studied mountain rivers. Both factors thus need to be considered for mapping and mitigating flash flood hazards also in this kind of low range mountains. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.", "label": "False"}

In each scenario, we aim to minimize the UAV periodic flight duration or mission completion time, while satisfying the target data requirement of each GU via a joint UAV trajectory and communication resource allocation design approach. Iterative algorithms are proposed to find efficient locally optimal solutions by utilizing successive convex optimization and block coordinate descent techniques.
