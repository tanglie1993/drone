The instability of slopes is a potential source of risks for mine safety. An unexpected slope failure may damage people, buildings, and equipment in the immediate area. Moreover, it leads to the disruption of mining production and an increase in production cost. For this reason, the regular examination and systematic monitoring of slopes should be performed to determine the early warning signs of failure. Thus, it may be possible to reach acceptable risk levels and to plan and implement the necessary safety measures. In this study, deformations at a common dump site of three different open-pit marble mines located in Eliktekke region of Amasya province (Turkey) were investigated by the permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique using satellite radar images. The results obtained from the PSI technique were compared with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry results which had been conducted by Hastaoglu et al. (2019) in the same study area. Velocities in the satellite line of sight (LOS) direction approaching -70 mm/month were determined from the PSI results of this dump site. Although the obtained results provided the overall coherence at this site, different results were found from GNSS and UAV photogrammetry in the areas where step geometry (height, width, inclination) changed along with the ongoing dumps and frequently changing surface topography due to dumping. While deformations occurring in slow motion and in a long time could be revealed by the PSI technique, displacements that occurred instantly and in a short time could not be determined. This study showed the detectability of surface deformations in open-pit mines by the PSI technique and problems that might be encountered during the analysis stage."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999963045120239}], "status": "success"}

Then, the carrier rocket releases the mission quadcopter at the high altitude and achieves flight deployment after an unfolding process. Subsequently, the airdropped mission quadcopter stabilizes its pose and flights toward the selected target point. During the flight, it adopts an autonomous ramp flying trajectory. Ramp flying is performed from the sky to the ground surface instead of conventional step shape flying to minimize the flight trajectory and energy consumed while flying.

Recent advances in ultra-wideband localization systems allow high accuracies for multiple active users in line-of-sight environments, while they still introduce errors above 300 mm in non-line-of-sight environments due to multi-path effects. Current work tries to improve the localization accuracy of ultra-wideband through offline error correction approaches using popular machine learning techniques. However, these techniques are still limited to simple environments with few multi-path effects and focus on offline correction. With the upcoming demand for high accuracy and low latency indoor localization systems, there is a need to deploy (online) efficient error correction techniques with fast response times in dynamic and complex environments. To address this, we propose (i) a novel semi-supervised autoencoder-based machine learning approach for improving ranging accuracy of ultra-wideband localization beyond the limitations of current improvements while aiming for performance improvements and a small memory footprint and (ii) an edge inference architecture for online UWB ranging error correction. As such, this paper allows the design of accurate localization systems by using machine learning for low-cost edge devices. Compared to a deep neural network (as state-of-the-art, with a baseline error of 75 mm) the proposed autoencoder achieves a 29% higher accuracy. The proposed approach leverages robust and accurate ultra-wideband localization, which reduces the errors from 214 mm without correction to 58 mm with correction. Validation of edge inference using the proposed autoencoder on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano demonstrates significant uplink bandwidth savings and allows up to 20 rapidly ranging anchors per edge GPU."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999961853027344}], "status": "success"}

It comprehensively considers the impact of various complex factors on the optimization results, such as the impact of distributed propulsors on the wing aerodynamics, the effect of wingtip propellers on the induced drag reduction, the coupling between wing aerodynamics and structure, the propeller/rotor aerodynamics optimization, and noise control. With the proposed method, it is possible to directly translate the top-level design requirements into the design scheme with the optimal specific system performance (such as the lowest delivery cost and highest delivery efficiency) at the very initial aircraft design stage, thereby greatly shortening the development cycle. A case study was presented. The results show that the introduction of distributed propulsors can increase the delivery efficiency by 28.2% and reduce the delivery cost by 15%; suppressing the wingtip vortices using propellers can increase the wing lift-drag ratio by 5.43%-6.65%; the slipstream generation efficiency and thrust efficiency are significantly different between different distributed propulsor schemes.

In contrast with current solutions mainly based on static and on-ground radars, this paper proposes the idea of a dynamic radar network of UAVs for real-time and high-accuracy tracking of malicious targets. To this end, we describe a solution for real-time navigation of UAVs to track a dynamic target using heterogeneously sensed information. Such information is shared by the UAVs with their neighbors via multi-hops, allowing tracking the target by a local Bayesian estimator running at each agent. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information gathering point-of-view, the UAVs plan their own trajectory by minimizing the posterior covariance matrix of the target state under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints.

This storm was a high-energy event that lasted 153 hours,with an average significant wave height of 4 m and a storm peak of 6.81 m., and water levels (tide and surge) of up to 4 m. The images derived from the UAS flights were processed with Structure From Motion (SfM) algorithms using Pix4D software, resulting in high-resolution mosaics and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the study area. These allowed (1) the digitization of the washover deposits in both sectors before and after the storm, and (2) the computation of DEMs of Difference (DoDs), which in turn allowed the analysis of volumetric estimates of erosion/accretion triggered by the significant overwash. The results revealed a non-uniform coastal response between both sectors. The area subject to higher degree of development showed a clear restriction in the onshore delivery of sediment during overwash due to the presence of a channel and a road, the coalescence of the nine pre-existing washovers into a unique deposit of 77546 m(2), and much higher damage extents and associated recovery costs. In the natural sector, the overwash processes reactivated the three pre-existing washovers (which enlarged their areas up to 200%) with no significant damages reported.

Getting drones to fly in formation is a relevant problem to be solved when cooperative cargo transportation is desired. A general approach for this problem considers the coordination of a fleet of UAVs, by fusing all information coming from several individual sensors posed on each UAVs. However, this approach induces a high cost as every UAV should have its advanced perception system. As an alternative, this paper proposes the use of a single perception system by a fleet composed of several elementary drones (workers) with primitive low-cost sensors and a leader drone carrying a 3D perception source.

On the other hand, UAVs can operate as mobile terminals to enable many applications such as item delivery and real-time video streaming. In such context, data-driven Deep Learning-assisted (DL) approaches are gaining a growing interest to not only exploit the huge amount of generated data, but also to optimize the network operations, and hence ensure the QoS requirements of these emerging wireless networks. However, UAVs are resource-constrained devices especially in terms of computing and power resources, and traditional DL-assisted schemes are cloud-centric, which require UAVs' data to be sent and stored in a centralized server. This represents a critical issue since it generates a huge network communication overhead to send raw data towards the centralized entity, and hence may lead to network bandwidth and energy inefficiency of UAV devices. In addition, the transferred data may contain personnel data such as UAVs' localization and identity, which can directly affect UAVs' privacy concerns. As a solution, Federated Deep Learning (FDL), or distributed DL, was introduced, where the basic idea is to keep raw data where it is generated, while sending only users' local trained DL models to the centralized entity for aggregation. Due to its privacy-preserving and low communication overhead and latency, FDL is much more adequate for many UAVs-enabled wireless applications.

We aim to achieve reliable on-time data delivery to the target nodes, while preserving the lowrouting cost. Our proposed routing methodology consists of three steps: 1) localized network construction, 2) network probing by UAVs, and 3) localized ad-hoc routing based on a dynamic depth routing tree depending on the data urgency. Here, we present an innovative cost-effective local data sharing structure called localized minimal routing tree that balances with the direct data delivery by UAVs. After the initial network setup and probing procedure, each UAV makes a series of near-optimal decisions of which grid points to visit considering its localized network topology and data urgency. Our time-dependent routing mechanism dynamically decides data recipient nodes to serve more urgent data delivery with a higher priority at a time. The simulation experiments validated our combined path planning and routing approach, achieving 71% higher reliability than the best possible performance by using only the network nodes and consuming 20% lower energy than theUAV-only approach, while maintaining high reliability.

Using unmanned aircraft, structurefrom-motion photogrammetry, and ground-penetrating radar, we offer the first comprehensive assessment of the lithofacies and stratigraphic architecture of this regionally unique fluvial conglomerate. We interpret three lithofacies associations: (1) beds of chaotic breccias lining the exhumed valley wall (colluvium), (2) < 5-m-thick units dominated by horizontal to gently inclined (2-3 degrees) beds of granule to pebble conglomerates, and (3) 10-24-m-thick units of steeply inclined (similar to 30 degrees) beds of bouldery conglomerates, which dominate the channel fill. The deposit comprises at least four stories, but its thickest part is a deep scour filled by a single story of steeply inclined bouldery deposits. The direction of accretion of the giant bars was toward the paleovalley wall, where contemporaneous valley-side colluvium and bar deposits arc juxtaposed. We propose that increased discharge in a high-order trunk stream rapidly eroded the friable sandstone of the underlying Monroe Creek-Harrison formations, amassing resistant, large concretions that were subject to valley-slope mass movements and fluvial transport (subaqueous traction, grainflow, and debris flow). Giant accretion surfaces formed as fluvial bars migrated over the edges of deep scours. Thus, the funneling of increased discharges through a confined paleovalley amplified the magnitudes of valley and bed erosion, water depth, stream competence, and bar thickness, preserving an exceptionally thick, coarse-grained deposit."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

This paper describes experiments carried out on a chronic release of crude oil and aims to understand the residence time of oil slicks using a combination of remote sensing platforms and GPS tracked drifters. From April 2017 to August 2018, we performed multiple synchronized deployments of drogued and un-drogued drifters to monitor the life time (residence time) of the surface oil slicks originated from the MC20 spill site, located close to the Mississippi Delta. The hydrodynamic design of the two types of drifters allowed us to compare their performance differences. We found the un-drogued drifter to be more appropriate to measure the speed of oil transport. Drifter deployments under various wind conditions show that stronger winds lead to reduce the length of the slick, presumably because of an increase in the evaporation rate and entrainment of oil in the water produced by wave action. We have calculated the residence time of oil slicks at MC20 site to be between 4 and 28 h, with average wind amplitude between 3.8 and 8.8 m/s.

The results show that moths do not favor detailed obstacle location information in navigation, but rely heavily on optical flow. Using the policy learned from the moth data as a starting point, we propose an actor-critic learning algorithm to refine policy parameters and obtain a policy that can be used by an autonomous aerial vehicle operating in a cluttered environment. Compared with the moths' policy, the policy we obtain integrates both obstacle location and optical flow. We compare the performance of these two policies in terms of their ability to navigate in artificial forest areas. While the optimized policy can adjust its parameters to outperform the moth's policy in each different terrain, the moth's policy exhibits a high level of robustness across terrains. Author summary Many animals exhibit a remarkable ability to navigate in complex forest terrains. Can we learn their navigation strategy from observed flying trajectories? Further, can we refine these strategies to design UAV/drone navigation policies in dense cluttered terrains? To that end, we propose a method to analyze data from hawkmoth flight trajectories in a closed-loop virtual forest and extract the navigation control policy. We find that moths rely heavily on optical flow rather than detailed information on the location of obstacles around them.

Modeling and predicting the biomass and yield of individual plants at the farm scale represents a major challenge in precision agriculture, particularly when salinity and other abiotic stresses may play a role. Here, we evaluate a diversity panel of the wild tomato species (Solanum pimpinellifolium) through both field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based phenotyping of 600 control and 600 salt-treated plants. The study objective was to predict fresh shoot mass, tomato fruit numbers, and yield mass at harvest based on a range of variables derived from the UAV imagery. UAV-based red-green-blue (RGB) imageries collected 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks before harvest were also used to determine if prediction accuracies varied between control and salt-treated plants. Multispectral UAV-based imagery was also collected 1 and 2 weeks prior to harvest to further explore predictive insights. In order to estimate the end of season biomass and yield, a random forest machine learning approach was implemented using UAV-imagery-derived predictors as input variables. Shape features derived from the UAV, such as plant area, border length, width, and length, were found to have the highest importance in the predictions, followed by vegetation indices and the entropy texture measure. The multispectral UAV imagery collected 2 weeks prior to harvest produced the highest explained variances for fresh shoot mass (87.95%), fruit numbers (63.88%), and yield mass per plant (66.51%). The RGB UAV imagery produced very similar results to those of the multispectral UAV dataset, with the explained variance reducing as a function of increasing time to harvest. The results showed that predicting the yield of salt-stressed plants produced higher accuracies when the models excluded control plants, whereas predicting the yield of control plants was not affected by the inclusion of salt-stressed plants within the models. This research demonstrates that it is possible to predict the average biomass and yield up to 8 weeks prior to harvest within 4.23% of field-based measurements and up to 4 weeks prior to harvest at the individual plant level.

These constraints can lead to long turnaround times for laboratory diagnostic tests and hamper epidemic control or patient treatment efforts. Although uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS)-ie, drones-can mitigate some of these transportation constraints, their cost-effectiveness compared with land-based transportation systems is unclear. Methods We did a comparative economic study of the costs and cost-effectiveness of UAS versus motorcycles in Liberia (west Africa) for transportation of laboratory samples under simulated routine conditions and public health emergency conditions (based on the 2013-16 west African Ebola virus disease epidemic). We modelled three UAS with operational ranges of 30 km, 65 km, and 100 km (UAS30, UAS65, and UAS100) and lifespans of 1000 to 10 000 h, and compared the costs and number of samples transported with an established motorcycle transportation programme (most commonly used by the Liberian Ministry of Health and the charity Riders for Health). Data for UAS were obtained from Skyfire (a UAS consultancy), Vayu (a UAS manufacturer), and Sandia National Laboratories (a private company with UAS research experience). Motorcycle operational data were obtained from Riders for Health. In our model, we included costs for personnel, equipment, maintenance, and training, and did univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for UAS lifespans, range, and accident or failures. Findings Under the routine scenario, the per sample transport costs were US$0.65 (95% CI 0.01-2.85) and $0.82 (0.56-5.05) for motorcycles and UAS65, respectively. Per-sample transport costs under the emergency scenario were $24.06 (95% CI 21.14-28.20) for motorcycles, $27.42 (95% CI 19.25-136.75) for an unadjusted UAS model with insufficient geographical coverage, and $34.09 (95% CI 26.70-12740) for an adjusted UAS model with complementary motorcycles. Motorcycles were more cost-effective than short-range UAS (ie, UAS30). However, with increasing range and operational lifespans, UAS became increasingly more cost-effective. Interpretation Given the current level of technology, purchase prices, equipment lifespans, and operational flying ranges, UAS are not a viable option for routine transport of laboratory samples in west Africa.

Moreover, UAVs controlled by the models usually converge to destinations slowly. Heuristic planning algorithms are also mainstream approaches to guide UAVs.

The velocity-aware algorithm generates paths with acceleration vectors that converge to the predefined destinations. The collision avoidance algorithm will be triggered to protect UAVs from collisions when path conflicts are predicted. Compared with hierarchical control model and Lyapunov-like control laws, our approach could improve success possibility of mission achievement for UAVs.

During a replenishment process, the relation between energy consumption and flight characteristic of a drone should be carefully taken in to account, because motional energy consumption is much more than the communicational and computational ones. For this purpose, we provide an energy aware endurance framework by modeling an energy consumption digraph model, representing an Aerial Pickup and Delivery Problem (APDP) for flight planning and implementing a novel algorithmic solution.

In this paper, incorporating UAVs into vehicular networks, a novel data delivery scheme, named UAV-assisted data delivery (UADD), is proposed for smart transportation networks. We introduce a novel concept called \"opportunistic virtual intersections\", at which UAVs can communicate with ground vehicles, and assist to deliver data packets. Specifically, at an opportunistic virtual intersection, UAVs may act as a relay, which can relay data packets between two vehicles as an intermediate hop, or deliver data packets in a store-carry-and-forward manner. The data forwarding rules are devised based on expected delivery delay and delivery probability of data packets.

These sensors were evaluated during two contrasted field campaigns performed at an urban site, impacted mainly by local traffic and domestic wood burning sources (Athens, Greece), and at a remote regional background site, impacted by long-range transported sources including dust (Cyprus Atmospheric Observatory, Agia Marina Xyliatou, Cyprus). The miniaturized sensors were first intercompared at the ground-level against two commercially available instruments used as a reference. The measured signal of the miniaturized sensors was converted into the absorption coefficient and equivalent black carbon concentration (eBC). When applicable, signal saturation corrections were applied, following the suggestions of the manufacturers. The aerosol absorption sensors exhibited similar behavior against the reference instruments during the two campaigns, despite the diversity of the aerosol origin, chemical composition, sources, and concentration levels. The deviation from the reference during both campaigns concerning (eBC) mass was less than 8 %, while for the absorption coefficient it was at least 15 %. This indicates that those sensors that report black carbon mass are tuned and corrected to measure eBC more accurately than the absorption coefficient. The overall potential use of miniature aerosol absorption sensors on board small UASs is also illustrated. UAS-based absorption measurements were used to investigate the vertical distribution of eBC over Athens up to 1 km above sea level during January 2016, exceeding the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Our results reveal a heterogeneous boundary layer concentration of absorbing aerosol within the PBL intensified in the early morning hours due to the concurrent peak traffic emissions at ground-level and the fast development of the boundary layer.

This single distribution channel cannot prioritize services for consumers closer to the distribution center, resulting in a waste of distribution resources. To deal with the last-kilometer delivery problem, this paper attempts to build a dual-channel distribution system consisting of UAVs and couriers.

It is proved that the improved revenue sharing contract can realize the coordination of the dual-channel distribution between UAVs and the couriers. The numerical examples verify the effectiveness of the model and contract coordination. According to the research, first, with the increase in the uncertainties of the delivery quantity, the profit of the UAV channel shows a downward trend, while the profit of the courier channel remains basically the same. This is because the labor cost of the courier channel is relatively stable. Second, with the increase in the market allocation proportion of the last-kilometer delivery, the optimal delivery quantity of the UAV channel and the optimal order quantity of the courier channel are both increasing, while the overall profit of the last-kilometer is first rising and then decreasing.

Results show that although the average surface ozone level was relatively low, strong ozone variability and high ozone concentrations occurred at the upper air. The maximum observed ozone concentration was 220 ppb. In addition, using meteorological profiles and backward trajectories, we found that the ozone elevation aloft can be attributed to the downward transport of air flow from higher altitudes.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial could be a novel and feasible platform to generate more timely and high resolution forest 3D canopy images. In spring, the forest is supposed to experience rapid growth. In this research, we used a small UAV to monitor campus forest growth in spring at 2-day intervals. Each time, 140 images were acquired and the ground surface dense point cloud was reconstructed at high precision. Excess Green indexes (ExG) was used to extract the green canopy points. The segmented point cloud was triangulated using the greedy projection triangulation method into a mesh and its area was calculated. Forest canopy growth was analyzed at three levels: forest level, selected group level and individual tree level. A logistic curve was used to fit the time series canopy growth. Strong correlation was found R-2 = 0.8517 at forest level, R-2 = 0.9652 at selected group level and R-2 = 0.9606 at individual tree level. Moreover, high correlation was found between canopies. By observing these results, we can conclude that the ground 3D model can act as a useful data type to monitor forest growth.

Most UAVs are equipped with wireless local area network (WLAN) and use carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. However, the network performance of CSMA/CA is largely degraded in UAV-relay network systems (URNSs), owing to collisions caused by contention at each hop. Thus, improving network performance is important. Moreover, there are additional requirements: designing a lightweight UAV relay and avoiding unnecessary relays. In this paper, URNS architecture and time-mirroring CSMA/CA (TM-CSMA/CA) are proposed to satisfy these requirements. First, a URNS architecture is designed to support the lightweight relay, performed without a media access control (MAC) layer, and to avoid unnecessary relays at the UAV by only using the physical layer. Second, TM-CSMA/CA guarantees that the UAV relay always wins contention by adjusting the defer time without a MAC layer. Thus, TM-CSMA/CA provides better network performance than CSMA/CA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no mathematical model for analyzing end-to-end delay of CSMA/CA. Thus, we construct mathematical models to analyze both saturation throughput and delay of two-hop delivery of CSMA/CA and TM-CSMA/CA.

The evaluation by bridge inspectors from 12 states across the USA demonstrated that all of the identified problems, except for being subjective, can be improved using the proposed framework. Practical implications - The proposed framework enables to: collect and document accurate bridge inspection data, reduce the number of site visits and avoid data overload and facilitate a more efficient, cost-effective and safer bridge inspection process. Originality/value This paper contributes a novel and systematic framework for the collection and integration of inspection data for bridge inspection and management. The findings from the case study suggest that the proposed framework should help improve current bridge inspection and management practice. Furthermore, the difficulties experienced during the implementation are evaluated, which should be helpful for improving the efficiency and the degree of automation of the proposed framework further."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999960660934448}], "status": "success"}

Hyperscale surveys with spatial extents of <1 km(2) have been widely demonstrated by means of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. Recent advances in the development and integration of global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial measurement unit (IMU) and lightweight laser scanning technologies are now resulting in the emergence of personal mobile laser scanners (MLS) that have the potential to increase data acquisition and processing rates by one to two orders of magnitude compared to TLS/SfM, and thus challenge the recent dominance of these technologies. This investigation compares a personal MLS survey using a Leica Pegasus Backpack that integrates Velodyne Puck VLP-16 sensors, and a multi-station static TLS survey using a Riegl VZ-1000 scanner, to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) and surface sedimentology maps. The assessment is undertaken on a 500 m long reach of the braided River Feshie. Comparison to 107 independent real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS check points resulted in similar mean error (ME) and standard deviation error (SDE) for TLS (ME = -0.025 m; SDE = 0.038 m) and personal MLS (ME = -0.014 m; SDE = 0.019 m). Direct cloud-to-cloud (C2C) comparison between a sample of TLS and personal MLS observations (2.8 million points) revealed that C2C distances follow a sharply decreasing Burr distribution (a = 2.35, b = 3.19, rate parameter s = 9.53). Empirical relationships between sub-metre topographic variability and median sediment grain size (10-100 mm) demonstrate that surface roughness from personal MLS can be used to map median grain size. Differences between TLS and personal MLS empirical relationships suggest such relationships are dependent on survey technique. Personal MLS offers distinct logistical advantages over SfM photogrammetry and TLS for particular survey situations and is likely to become a widely applied technique.

The relationships between these length scales show how tidal variability and bathymetric effects change the balance of wave and river momentum. The most frequently observed state is L-SZ>L-NF. Under these conditions the surf zone traps the outflowing river plume and the river water's initial propagation into the surf zone is set by L-NF.

At high water during low wave forcing, L-C>L-SZ, such that minimal wave breaking occurs in the channel and river water escapes onto the shelf. Based on the discharge, wave, and tidal conditions, the conceptual model is used to predict the fate of river water from the Quinault over a year, showing that approximately 70% of the river discharge is trapped in the surf zone upon exiting the river mouth."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999961853027344}], "status": "success"}

The latter are visible where there is a turbidity difference between the two tributaries, whereas the former are usually derived from mean velocity measurements or numerical simulations. Few field studies recorded turbulent velocity fluctuations at high frequency to investigate these structures, particularly at medium-sized confluences where logistical constraints make it difficult to use devices such as acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV). This study uses the ice cover present at the confluence of the Mitis and Neigette Rivers in Quebec (Canada) to obtain long-duration, fixed measurements along the mixing zone. The confluence is also characterized by a marked turbidity difference which allows to investigate the mixing zone dynamics from drone imagery during ice-free conditions. The aim of the study is to characterize and compare the flow structure in the mixing zone at a medium-sized (similar to 40 m) river confluence with and without an ice cover. Detailed 3D turbulent velocity measurements were taken under the ice along the mixing plane with an ADV through eight holes at around 20 positions on the vertical. For ice-free conditions, drone imagery results indicate that large (KH) coherent structures are present, occupying up to 50% of the width of the parent channel. During winter, the ice cover affects velocity profiles by moving the highest velocities towards the centre of the profiles. Large turbulent structures are visible in both the streamwise and lateral velocity components. The strong correlation between these velocity components indicates that KH vortices are the dominating coherent structures in the mixing zone.

The problem of diffuse pollution can be conceptualised with a sourcemobilisation-pathway (or delivery)-impact model, whereby the combination of high source risk and strong connected pathways leads to 'critical source areas' (CSAs). These areas are where most diffuse pollution will originate, and hence are the optimal places to implement mitigation measures. However, identifying the locations of these areas is a key problem across different spatial scales within catchments. A number of approaches are frequently used for this assessment, although comparisons of these assessments are rarely carried out. We evaluate the CSAs identified via traditional walkover surveys supported by three different approaches, highlighting their benefits and disadvantages. These include a custom designed smartphone app; a desktop geographic information system (GIS) and terrain analysis-based SCIMAP (Sensitive Catchment Integrated Modelling and Analysis Platform) approach; and the use of a high spatial resolution drone dataset as an improved input data for SCIMAP modelling. Each of these methods captures the locations of the CSAs, revealing similarities and differences in the prioritisation of CSA features. The differences are due to the temporal and spatial resolution of the three methods such as the use of static land cover information, the ability to capture small scale features, such as gateways and the incomplete catchment coverage of the walkover survey. The relative costs and output resolutions of the three methods indicate that they are suitable for application at different catchment scales in conjunction with other methods. Based on the results in this paper, it is recommended that a multi-evidence-based approach to diffuse pollution management is taken across catchment spatial scales, incorporating local knowledge from the walkover with the different data resolutions of the SCIMAP approach."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999963045120239}], "status": "success"}

In this case, it is necessary to deliver messages quickly and efficiently to the ground station through mutual cooperation between UAVs. Many methods used in this case have problems such as unbalanced popularity (the ratio of the relayed message number to the total message number) of nodes, large proportion of ping-pong effect, and long delay. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a method named PB (Popularity Balance Method for UAVs in the same area layer) based on division of the whole search area. The method divides the search area into multiple area layers. Message transmission between area layers adopts a geographical routing manner, that is, messages are transmitted to the area layer closer to the ground station. The division of the search area changes the pattern of message transmission. Messages are delivered to the area layer closer to the destination node rather than the node closer to the destination. The pattern causes messages' passing direction to be replaced by \"point-to-point closer\" to \"point-to-face closer.\" On the basis of message transmission at area layers, reasonable planning of UAVs' distribution can effectively improve the network performance deterioration caused by a \"hot spot.\" Both analysis and experiments show that PB is superior to some existing methods in popularity balance of nodes and ping-pong effect.

Design/methodology/approach Experimental investigation using a bench test and the statistical analysis of data to reflect the knock combustion characteristics of the two-stroke SI unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) engine on RP-3 kerosene fuel. Findings Under the full load condition of 4,000 rpm, at the ignition timing of 25 degree of crank angle (degrees CA) before top dead centre (BTDC), the knock combustion is sensitive to the thinner mixture; therefore, the knock begins to occur when the excess air ratio is larger than 1.0. When the excess air ratio is set as 1.2, the knock obviously appears with the highest knock intensity. At the excess air ratio of 1.2, better engine performance is obtained at the ignition timing range of 20-30 degrees CA BTDC. However, the ignition timing at 30 degrees CA BTDC significantly increases the peak combustion pressure and knock intensity with the advancing heat release process. Practical implications - Gasoline has a low flash point, a high-saturated vapour pressure and relatively high volatility, and it is a potential hazard near a naked flame at room temperature, which can create significant security risks for its storage, transport and use. The authors adopt a low-volatility single RP-3 kerosene fuel for all vehicles and equipment to minimise the number of different devices using various fuels and improve the military application safety. Originality/value Most two-stroke SI UAV engines for military applications burn gasoline. A kerosene-based fuel for stable engine operation can be achieved because the knock combustion can be effectively suppressed through the combined adjustment of the fuel amount and spark timing."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999947547912598}], "status": "success"}

Small versions of UAS, here called \"sUAS,\" in particular, have become so prevalent that they can be easily purchased at general retail stores. This paper seeks to review and summarize the use of sUAS in volcanic research. Given their size, low cost, and relative durability, sUAS provide a light-weight tool platform that is easy to transport to field locations; quick to set-up; and easy to launch, and control. They require very little launch and recovery space. Because of these characteristics, sUAS are useful in collecting immediate and realtime aerial data, especially in remote, inaccessible, dynamic, and/or hazardous, volcanic environments. In volcanic areas, sUAS have been used for mapping, sample collection, thermal imaging, magnetic surveys, slope stability studies, and as platforms for sensors to measure outgassing of CO2 and SO2. They are also becoming invaluable for real-time hazard assessment during and after an eruption. They are, however, limited by their flight time, which is greatly affected by wind speeds. Since they are predominately made of plastic, they are also impacted by the high thermal temperatures found in active volcanic areas, which can degrade their structure and performance. With continued technological improvement however, sUAS have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to collect field data. Because of additional natural, technological, and legal challenges related to their use, it is critical that users be aware of, and adhere to, all national and local laws associated with sUAS.

In recent years, UAVs have been used to release predatory mites and other natural enemies to optimise and promote sustainable pest management practices by relying less on conventional insecticides. Drone dispensed samples of predatory mites are typically mixed with a granular material, vermiculite, which serves as a filler. The low density of the vermiculite and weather conditions (mainly wind), influences the distribution pattern of predatory mites when delivered by a UAV-based system. The purpose of this paper is to present a data driven methodology to develop a mathematical model that can be used to optimise UAV-based autonomous dispensing of predatory mites. The model characterises the distribution of vermiculite as a function of wind speed and direction, and the UAVs altitude and forward speed. The model is constructed by first conducting outdoor experiments and then using machine-learning techniques on the collected data. The constructed model produced an average generalisation error of 12.8%, RMSE.

Although control, navigation, and communication technologies are becoming available on individual flight units, system-level motion management for dense UAS traffic remains an open question. This paper presents a motion-planning model based on nonlinear optimization techniques to centrally coordinate paths for all vehicles traversing a shared two-dimensional (2D) space. An exact bound is derived to characterize the discrete-time separation constraints, and a set of new metrics is proposed to measure 2D traffic flow efficiency. The grand goal is to make all vehicles that come under dispatch reach their respective destinations quickly and efficiently while maintaining a safe intervehicle separation at all times. This infinite-horizon operational problem is formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex optimization model that must be solved in a progressive, receding-horizon fashion. To ensure feasibility and overcome path deadlocks attributed to local optima, a series of heuristic measures are developed. By pivoting on artfully coined intermediate feasibility, the algorithm is able to circumvent imminent deadlocks in a predictive manner and progressively construct the solution with guaranteed feasibility.

Moreover, in urban areas, sUAVs can deliver packages to customers without negatively affecting street traffic. To conduct urban operations, sUAS-based delivery systems must obey regulations for sUAS operations and avoid urban obstacles. In this paper, a maximum-flight-time-constrained multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows optimization model is used to create routes for sUAS-based delivery missions. To address the actual urban environment with the optimization model, a two-layered urban flight network is built by feeding an airborne light detection and ranging sensor data into an algorithm that uses a Voronoi diagram to create collision-free paths.

However, pre-erosion high-resolution topographic data (e.g. lidar) is often not available and determining specific contributions from post-fire hillslope and channel erosion is challenging. The impact of post-fire erosion on landscape evolution is demonstrated with Structure from Motion (SfM) Multi-View Stereo (MVS) photogrammetry in a 1 km(2) Idaho Batholith catchment burned in the 2016 Pioneer Fire. We use SfM-MVS to quantify post-fire erosion without detailed pre-erosion topography and hillslope transects to improve estimates of rill erosion at adequate spatial scales. Widespread rilling and channel erosion produced a runoff-generated debris-flow following modest precipitation in October 2016. We implemented unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based SfM-MVS to derive a 5 cm resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the channel scoured by debris-flow. In the absence of cm-resolution pre-erosion topography, a synthetic surface was defined by the debris-flow scour's geomorphic signature and we used a DEM of Difference (DoD) to map and quantify channel erosion. We found 3467 +/- 422 m(3) was eroded by debris-flow scour. Rill dimensions along hillslope transects and Monte Carlo simulation show rilling eroded similar to 1100 m(3) of sediment and define a volume uncertainty of 29%.

These aspects include the characteristics of the UAV fleet (e.g., size of fleet, UAV specifications and capabilities), the energy consumption (highly affected by weather conditions and payload) and the characteristics of the network and customer locations. All these aspects must be taken into account when aiming to achieve deliveries to customers in a safe and timely manner. However, at present, there is a lack of decision support tools and methods for mission planners that consider all these influencing aspects together. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a decomposed solution approach, which provides decision support for UAVs' fleet mission planning. The proposed approach assists flight mission planners in aerospace companies to select and evaluate different mission scenarios, for which flight-mission plans are obtained for a given fleet of UAVs, while guaranteeing delivery according to customer requirements in a given time horizon. Mission plans are analyzed from multiple perspectives including different weather conditions (wind speed and direction), payload capacities of UAVs, energy capacities of UAVs, fleet sizes, the number of customers visited by a UAV on a mission and delivery performance. The proposed decision support-driven declarative model supports the selection of the UAV mission planning scenarios subject to variations on all these configurations of the UAV system and variations in the weather conditions. The computer simulation based experimental results, provides evidence of the applicability and relevance of the proposed method. This ultimately contributes as a prototype of a decision support system of UAVs fleet-mission planning, able to determine whether is it possible to find a flight-mission plan for a given fleet of UAVs guaranteeing customer satisfaction under the given conditions. The mission plans are created in such a manner that they are suitable to be sent to Air Traffic Control for flight approval."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999872446060181}], "status": "success"}

It acts as a critical co-factor of many enzymes that play key roles in diverse cellular processes. The present study attempts to investigate the regulatory functions decisively controlling copper trafficking during development and aging of the Drosophila model system. Hence, through engagement of the GAL4/UAS genetic platform and RNAi technology, we herein examined the in vivo significance of Atox1 and CCS genes, products of which pivotally govern cellular copper trafficking in fly tissue pathophysiology. Specifically, we analyzed the systemic effects of their targeted downregulation on the eye, wing, neuronal cell populations and whole-body tissues of the fly. Our results reveal that, in contrast to the eye, suppression of their expression in the wing leads to a notable increase in the percentage of malformed organs observed. Furthermore, we show that Atox1 or CCS gene silencing in either neuronal or whole-body tissues can critically affect the viability and climbing capacity of transgenic flies, while their double-genetic targeting suggests a rather synergistic mode of action of the cognate protein products. Interestingly, pharmacological intervention with the anti-cancer drug cisplatin indicates the major contribution of CCS copper chaperone to cisplatin's cellular trafficking, and presumably to tumor resistance often acquired during chemotherapy. Altogether, it seems that Atox1 and CCS proteins serve as tissue/organ-specific principal regulators of physiological Drosophila development and aging, while their tissue-dependent downregulation can provide important insights for Atox1 and CCS potential exploitation as predictive gene biomarkers of cancer-cell chemotherapy responses."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999958276748657}], "status": "success"}

In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligencebased localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligencebased clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead.

Caching provides ephemeral storage of data on designated servers for low-latency transmissions. However, with the network following a hierarchical layout, even the near-user site evaluations can be impacted by the overheads associated with maintaining a perpetual connection and other factors (e.g., those relating to the reliability of the underpinning network). Prior solutions study reliability as a factor of throughput, delays, jitters, or delivery ratio. However, with modern networks supporting high data rates, a current research trend is in ultrareliability. The latter is defined in terms of availability, connectivity, and survivability. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the ultrareliable communication in MEC. Specifically, in our setting, we use drones as on-demand nodes for efficient caching. While some existing solutions use cache-enabled drones, they generally focus only on the positioning problem rather than factors relating to ultrareliable communications. We present a novel neural-blockchain-based drone-caching approach, designed to ensure ultrareliability and provide a flat architecture (via blockchain). This neural-model fortifies an efficient transport mechanism, since blockchain maintains high reliability amongst the peers involved in the communications. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed approach scores well in the following metrics: the probability of connectivity reaches 0.99; energy consumption is decreased by 60.34%; the maximum failure rate is affected by 13.0%; survivability is greater than 0.90; reliability reaches 1.0 even for a large set of users."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999957084655762}], "status": "success"}

The hydroecological impacts are wide ranging and generally positive, however, the hydrogeochemical characteristics of beaver-induced flowpaths have not been thoroughly examined. Using a suite of complementary ground- and drone-based heat tracing and remote sensing methodology we characterized the physical template of beaver-induced floodplain exchange for two alluvial mountain streams near Crested Butte, Colorado, USA. A flowpath-oriented perspective to water quality sampling allowed characterization of the chemical evolution of channel water diverted through floodplain beaver ponds and ultimately back to the channel in 'beaver pond return flows'. Subsurface return flow seepages were universally suboxic, while ponds and surface return flows showed a range of oxygen concentration due to in-situ photosynthesis and atmospheric mixing. Median concentrations of reduced metals: manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and arsenic (As) were substantially higher along beaver-induced flowpaths than in geologically controlled seepages and upstream main channel locations. The areal footprint of reduced return seepage flowpaths were imaged with surface electromagnetic methods, indicating extensive zones of high-conductivity shallow groundwater flowing back toward the main channels and emerging at relatively warm bank seepage zones observed with infrared. Multiple-depth redox dynamics within one focused seepage zone showed coupled variation over time, likely driven by observed changes in seepage rate that may be controlled by pond stage. High-resolution times series of dissolved Mn and Fe collected downstream of the beaver-impacted reaches demonstrated seasonal dynamics in mixed river metal concentrations. Al time series concentrations showed proportional change to Fe at the smaller stream location, indicating chemically reduced flowpaths were sourcing Al to the channel.

{"original_data": {"PT": "J", "TI": "Spatio-temporal dynamics of sediment transfer systems in landslide-prone Alpine catchments", "AB": "Tectonic and geomorphic processes drive landscape evolution over different spatial and temporal scales. In mountainous environments, river incision sets the pace of landscape evolution, and hillslopes respond to channel incision by, e.g., gully retreat, bank erosion, and landslides. Sediment produced during stochastic landslide events leads to mobilization of soil and regolith on the slopes that can later be transported by gravity and water to the river network during phases of hillslope-channel geomorphic coupling. The mechanisms and scales of sediment connectivity mitigate the propagation of sediment pulses throughout the landscape and eventually drive the contribution of landslides to the overall sediment budget of mountainous catchments. However, to constrain the timing of the sediment cascade, the inherent stochastic nature of sediment and transport through landsliding requires an integrated approach accounting for different space scales and timescales. In this paper, we examine the sediment production on hillslopes and evacuation to the river network of one landslide, i.e. the Schimbrig earthflow, affecting the Entle River catchment located in the foothills of the Central Swiss Alps. We quantified sediment fluxes over annual, decadal, and millennial timescales using respectively unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-structurefrom-motion (SfM) techniques, classic photogrammetry, and in situ produced cosmogenic radionuclides. At the decadal scale, sediment fluxes quantified for the period 1962-1998 are highly variable and are not directly linked to the intensity of sediment redistribution on the hillslope. At the millennial scale, landslide occurrence perturbs the regional positive linear relationship between sediment fluxes and downstream distance as the landslide-affected Schimbrig catchment is characterized by a decrease in sediment fluxes and a strong variability. Importantly, the average decadal sediment flux of the Schimbrig catchment is 2 orders of magnitude higher than millennial sediment fluxes computed over the same spatial extent. The discrepancy between decadal and millennial sediment fluxes, combined to the highly variable annual sediment evacuation from the hillslopes to the channel network suggest that phases of hillslope-channel geomorphic coupling are short and intermittent. During most of the time, the first-order catchments are transport-limited and sediment dynamics in the headwaters are uncoupled from the fluvial systems. In addition, our unique spatio-temporal database of sediment fluxes highlights the transient character of the intense geomorphic activity of the Schimbrig catchment in a regional context. Its decadal sediment flux is of the same order of magnitude as the background sediment flux going out of the entire Entle River catchment. Over the last 50 years, the Schimbrig catchment, which represents ca. 1 % of the entire study area, provides 65 % of the sediments that the entire Entle catchment will supply over the millennial scale. These results suggest that episodic supply of sediment from landslides during intermittent phases of hillslope-channel geomorphic coupling are averaged out when considering sediment fluxes at longer timescales and larger spatial scales."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The seasonal brines of the largest salt plateau on Earth in Salar de Uyuni (Bolivian Altiplano) have been inadequately studied for their localized hydrodynamics and the regolith volume transport across the freshwater-brine mixing zones. These brines have recently been projected as a new analogue site for the proposed Martian brines, such as recurring slope lineae (RSL) and slope streaks. The Martian brines have been postulated to be the result of ongoing deliquescence-based salt-hydrology processes on contemporary Mars, similar to the studied Salar de Uyuni brines. As part of a field-site campaign during the cold and dry season in the latter half of August 2017, we deployed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at two sites of the Salar de Uyuni to perform detailed terrain mapping and geomorphometry. We generated high-resolution (2 cm/pixel) photogrammetric digital elevation models (DEMs) for observing and quantifying short-term terrain changes within the brines and their surroundings. The achieved co-registration for the temporal DEMs was considerably high, from which precise inferences regarding the terrain dynamics were derived. The observed average rate of bottom surface elevation change for brines was similar to 1.02 mm/day, with localized signs of erosion and deposition. Additionally, we observed short-term changes in the adjacent geomorphology and salt cracks. We conclude that the transferred regolith volume via such brines can be extremely low, well within the resolution limits of the remote sensors that are currently orbiting Mars, thereby making it difficult to resolve the topographic relief and terrain perturbations that are produced by such flows on Mars. Thus, the absence of observable erosion and deposition features within or around most of the proposed Martian RSL and slope streaks cannot be used to dismiss the possibility of fluidized flow within these features."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Providing testing access to the most remote populations and facilities (the \"last mile\") is especially challenging. Using a geospatial optimization model, we estimated the incremental costs of accessing the most remote 20% of patients in Zambia by expanding the transportation network required to bring blood samples from ART clinics to centralized laboratories and return results to clinics. Methods The model first optimized a sample transportation network (STN) that can transport 80% of anticipated sample volumes to centralized viral load testing laboratories on a daily or weekly basis, in line with Zambia's 2020 targets. Data incorporated into the model included the location and infrastructure of all health facilities providing ART, location of laboratories, measured distances and drive times between the two, expected future viral load demand by health facility, and local cost estimates. We then continued to expand the modelled STN in 5% increments until 100% of all samples could be collected. Results and Discussion The cost per viral load test when reaching 80% patient volumes using centralized viral load testing was a median of $18.99. With an expanded STN, the incremental cost per test rose to $20.29 for 80% to 85% and $20.52 for 85% to 90%. Above 90% coverage, the incremental cost per test increased substantially to $31.57 for 90% to 95% and $51.95 for 95% to 100%. The high numbers of kilometres driven per sample transported and large number of vehicles needed increase costs dramatically for reaching the clinics that serve the last 5% of patients. Conclusions Providing sample transport services to the most remote clinics in low- and middle-income countries is likely to be cost-prohibitive. Other strategies are needed to reduce the cost and increase the feasibility of making viral load monitoring available to the last 10% of patients. The cost of alternative methods, such as optimal point-of-care viral load equipment placement and usage, dried blood/plasma spot specimen utilization, or use of drones in geographically remote facilities, should be evaluated."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Under the stringent and inevitable limitations imposed by free-flow vehicular traffic conditions (i.e., low-to-medium vehicular densities, elevated degree of mobility, high speeds, etc), these networks suffer from considerably rapid topology variations leading to severe connectivity intermittence and, hence, delayed data delivery. This motivates the study presented in this paper, which aims at investigating the capability of external elements that are independent of the vehicular traffic flow and its inherent limitations (e.g., airborne unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a.k.a., drones) to serve as possible adjuvant relays; thus, contributing to strengthening/healing weak/broken communication links among ground-bound vehicular entities (i.e., RoadSide Units (RSUs) and vehicles) and uplifting the vehicular connectivity and delay performance.

Then, a stochastic analytical model is formulated for the purpose of mathematically characterizing the path availability and achieved data delivery delays in the presence of these UAVs.

In the absence of obstacles, satellite based navigation from departure to the geo-located destination is a simple task. When obstacles are known to be in the path, pilots must build a flight plan to avoid them. However, when they are unknown, there are too many or they are in places that are not fixed positions, then to build a safe flight plan becomes very challenging. Moreover, in a weak satellite signal environment, such as indoors, under trees canopy or in urban canyons, the current drone navigation systems may fail. Artificial intelligence, a research area with increasing activity, can be used to overcome such challenges. Initially focused on robots and now mostly applied to ground vehicles, artificial intelligence begins to be used also to train drones. Reinforcement learning is the branch of artificial intelligence able to train machines. The application of reinforcement learning to drones will provide them with more intelligence, eventually converting drones in fully-autonomous machines. In this work, reinforcement learning is studied for drone delivery. As sensors, the drone only has a stereo-vision front camera, from which depth information is obtained. The drone is trained to fly to a destination in a neighborhood environment that has plenty of obstacles such as trees, cables, cars and houses. The flying area is also delimited by a geo-fence; this is a virtual (non-visible) fence that prevents the drone from entering or leaving a defined area. The drone has to avoid visible obstacles and has to reach a goal. Results show that, in comparison with the previous results, the new algorithms have better results, not only with a better reward, but also with a reduction of its variance.

Insulin stored between -20 and 40 degrees C for 30 mins, and subjected to vibration (0-40 Hz, 25 degrees C, 30 mins) passed the pharmacopeia tests.

The network between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is one such collaboration, which comprises battery-powered static sensor nodes that act as sources and sinks and UAVs that act as relays. This collaborative network presents with opportunities and advantages, but at the same time, configuration of such networks is an arduous task. The WSN nodes are characterized by constant depleting power. Their network itself requires constant management and reconfiguration. These requisites can be slaked through the formation of an efficient data dissemination algorithm, which acclimates according to the network state. Considering this, a data dissemination approach is presented in this paper, which constructs a virtual topology predicated on the charge of WSN nodes utilizing software-defined networks (SDNs) through UAVs. The topology is constantly monitored and reconfigured when required. The aerial nodes are equipped with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas in order to facilitate simultaneous communication with the ground nodes, the base station, and the SDN controller. An efficient sleep timer and backoff counter strategies are also utilized by the proposed approach. The SDN controller facilitates the topology formation and maintenance of a sleep timer and a backoff counter. The proposed model is compared with clustered hierarchical layouts and hexagonal cell layouts through the network simulations.

The cooperation between multiple UAVs in the air exchanging data among themselves can naturally form a flying ad hoc network (FANET). Such networks can be the key support to accomplish several kinds of missions while providing the required assistance to terrestrial networks. However, they are confronted with many challenges and difficulties, which are due to the high mobility of UAVs, the frequent packet losses, and the weak links between UAVs, all affecting the reliability of the data delivery. Furthermore, the unbalanced energy consumption may result in earlier UAV failure and consequently accelerate the decrease of the network lifetime, thus disrupting the overall network. This paper supports the use of the movement information and the residual energy level of each UAV to guarantee a high level of communication stability while predicting a sudden link breakage prior to its occurrence. A robust route discovery process is used to explore routing paths where the balanced energy consumption, the link breakage prediction, and the connectivity degree of the discovered paths are all considered.

Therefore, understanding the initiation and runout characteristics of surges is essential when planning debris flow mitigation. Monitoring performed using 10 time-lapse cameras (TLCs) in Ohya landslide, central Japan, where debris flows occur frequently due to mobilization of storage (i.e., talus cone and channel deposits), allowed us to obtain data on a series of surge processes, from initiation to termination, which occurred during each debris flow event. We also analyzed temporal changes in the spatial distribution of storage in the debris flow initiation zone, associated with sediment supply from hillslopes and evacuation of sediment by the occurrence of debris flows, through periodic measurements of topography using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Debris flow surges were mainly induced by repetitive mass movement of storage through the erosion of channel deposits by overland flow, sliding of channel deposits, and sediment and water supply from channel banks and tributaries. Development of a spontaneous wave on the flow surface was not an important formation process of surges in the Ohya landslide. Many debris flow surges initiated at channel sections with deep storage (>2 m in depth), located <30 m below a junction with a tributary, when the maximum 10-min rainfall intensity exceeded 5 mm. Partly saturated flow, which has an unsaturated layer in its upper part, was the predominant flow type in the steep initiation zone, while fully saturated flow was predominant in the gentle transportation and deposition zones. Flow type often changed as the surges descended. Partly saturated flow was predominant when the volume of storage in the initiation zone was large, whereas fully saturated flow was predominant when the volume of storage was small. When we compared debris flows with similar total sediment volume, travel distance was long when fully saturated flow with high flow mobility was predominant because of the small volume of storage in the initiation zone. The volume of storage also affected flow path avulsion on the debris flow fan by controlling the flow mobility of surges. Consequently, the spatial distribution and total volume of storage are important factors controlling the initiation location, predominant flow type, and termination location of surges.

In remote regions, regular habitat assessments are logistically challenging and time consuming. Drones are increasingly being used by ecologists to conduct habitat assessments, but reliance on georeferenced data as ground truth may not always be feasible. We estimated goose habitat degradation using photointerpretation of drone imagery and compared estimates to those made with ground-based linear transects. In July 2016, we surveyed five study plots in La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, to evaluate the effectiveness of a fixed-wing drone with simple Red Green Blue (RGB) imagery for evaluating habitat degradation by snow geese. Ground-based land cover data was collected and grouped into barren, shrub, or non-shrub categories. We compared estimates between ground-based transects and those made from unsupervised classification of drone imagery collected at altitudes of 75, 100, and 120 m above ground level (ground sampling distances of 2.4, 3.2, and 3.8 cm respectively). We found large time savings during the data collection step of drone surveys, but these savings were ultimately lost during imagery processing. Based on photointerpretation, overall accuracy of drone imagery was generally high (88.8% to 92.0%) and Kappa coefficients were similar to previously published habitat assessments from drone imagery. Mixed model estimates indicated 75m drone imagery overestimated barren (F-2,F-182 = 100.03, P < 0.0001) and shrub classes (F-2,F-182 = 160.16, P < 0.0001) compared to ground estimates. Inconspicuous graminoid and forb species (non-shrubs) were difficult to detect from drone imagery and were underestimated compared to ground-based transects (F-2,F-182 = 843.77, P < 0.0001).

Since VANETs can comprise all kinds of mobile vehicles moving and changing direction frequently, this may result in frequent link failures and network partitions. Moreover, when VANETs are deployed in a city environment, another problem arises, that is, the existing obstructions (eg, buildings, trees, and hoppers) preventing the line-of-sight between vehicles, thus degrading wireless transmissions. Therefore, it is more complicated to design a routing technique that adapts to frequent changes in the topology. In order to settle all these problems, in this work, we design a flooding scheme that automatically reacts at each topology variation while overcoming the present obstacles while exchanging data in ad hoc mode with drones that are commonly called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Also, the aim of this work is to explore well-regulated routing paths providing a long lifetime connectivity based on the amount of traffic and the expiration time of each discovered path.

The idea of using two quadrotors working cooperatively to carry the load is adopted to suppress any load oscillation in the direction of movement, what would happen if just one UAV were used. As a consequence of using two UAVs (or more than two) it can happen collisions between the vehicles when carrying the load, caused by the forces the load exert on the two vehicles, whose tendency is to bring the vehicles closer one to the other when they accelerate forward. The paper proposes a strategy to avoid such collisions and any collision with obstacles eventually present in the working space as well.

In New Zealand, this phenomenon is of considerable concern as the area occupied by invasive exotic trees is large and increasing rapidly. Remote sensing methods offer a potential means of identifying and monitoring land infested by these trees, enabling managers to efficiently allocate resources for their control. In this study, we sought to develop methods for remote detection of exotic invasive trees, namely Pinus sylvestris and P. ponderosa. Critically, the study aimed to detect these species prior to the onset of maturity and coning as this is important for preventing further spread. In the study environment in New Zealand's South Island, these species reach maturity and begin bearing cones at a young age. As such, detection of these smaller individuals requires specialist methods and very high-resolution remote sensing data. We examined the efficacy of classifiers developed using two machine learning algorithms with multispectral and laser scanning data collected from two platforms-manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The study focused on a localized conifer invasion originating from a multi-species pine shelter belt in a grassland environment. This environment provided a useful means of defining the detection thresholds of the methods and technologies employed. An extensive field dataset including over 17,000 trees (height range = 1 cm to 476 cm) was used as an independent validation dataset for the detection methods developed. We found that data from both platforms and using both logistic regression and random forests for classification provided highly accurate (kappa <mml:semantics><0.996</mml:semantics>) detection of invasive conifers. Our analysis showed that the data from both UAV and manned aircraft was useful for detecting trees down to 1 m in height and therefore shorter than 99.3% of the coning individuals in the study dataset. We also explored the relative contribution of both multispectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in the detection of invasive trees through fitting classification models with different combinations of predictors and found that the most useful models included data from both sensors. However, the combination of ALS and multispectral data did not significantly improve classification accuracy. We believe that this was due to the simplistic vegetation and terrain structure in the study site that resulted in uncomplicated separability of invasive conifers from other vegetation. This study provides valuable new knowledge of the efficacy of detecting invasive conifers prior to the onset of coning using high-resolution data from UAV and manned aircraft.

Issues related to the intermittent nature of connectivity may arise due to the high mobility of nodes and network heterogeneity. In sparse areas, a vehicular network is basically a disruption-tolerant network suffering from frequent disconnections, long delays, and messages loss. Facing these issues, and specifically for time-sensitive applications, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can provide valuable assistance to Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) by assuming a relay node role between disconnected segments in the road. In such scenarios, effective communication is either between vehicles (V2V) or between vehicles and UAVs (V2U), which would form subsequently a UAV-assisted vehicular network. In the present paper, we propose a new framework for using small UAVs as mobile infrastructure nodes in order to enhance the connectivity between vehicles. The first part of this framework accurately predicts the disconnected segments such that drones can be deployed to reestablish lost links. We have implemented a theoretical game for this prediction process. Furthermore, since the battery reserves of the UAVs are limited, we have proposed a mitigation technique based on game theory to reduce the power draining effects that a broadcast storm would have on the energy consumption of the network.

UAVs, or as known as drones, have appeared to be productive in finishing complex errands when sorted out as ad hoc connected groups, thereby bringing into existence a Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET). Owing to its specific characteristics such as high mobility, rapid topology changes, and frequent link failures, FANETs bring further challenges into these networks. Therefore, developing an efficient routing protocol over FANETs is a very challenging matter and consequently triggered the attention of a lot of current researchers. In this article, we propose a Multi Data Rate Mobility Aware (MDRMA) protocol in which novel routing and power controlled mechanisms have been suggested. Basically, MDRMA protocol is considered as a major extension of Mobility Aware Dual Phase Ad-hoc on-demand Distance Vector with Adaptive Hello Messages (MA-DP-AODV-AHM) protocol. Particularly, in MDRMA-Routing algorithm, the establishment of routes is not arbitrarily but rather is conditioned upon the achievement of certain requirements which can be extracted from the positive answers of the questions follow. Is that intermediate UAV able of affording the possible transmission rate requested by the source UAV? Are the transmitting and receiving UAVs not thrifting away from each other? Does the speed of that intermediate UAV not exceed a certain threshold? Upon the efficient deal of prior concerns, MDRMA-Routing algorithm guarantees establishing stable routes with fast data forwarding wireless links. Not only to this extent, MDRMA-Power controlled algorithm also adds some modifications on 802.11b standard, explicitly on RTS/CTS collision avoidance technique, to maintain the minimum transmission power required by a transmitting UAV for a successful reception of packets at target UAV and at a desired data transmission rate bearing in mind the receiver sensitivity and signal-to-interference-noise ratio threshold, thereby enforcing fast data forwarding. The performance of our protocol has been evaluated in the perspectives of end-to-end delay, control overhead, and packet delivery ratio using NS3 simulator in which enormous simulations have been conducted under the base of UAVs' density, packet rate and constant bit rate connections. Simulation results summarize that MDRMA contributes efficiently in mitigating the network instability through generating fast and stable routes and reducing link failures.

In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground) vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed in this paper.

Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network's backbone to transfer EVs' requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid.

This study presents high-frequency measurements of incident and near surface wind flow and aeolian sand transport on a lagoon sand cay (Maaodegalaa) in the Maldives. Sonic anemometers and Wenglor (TM) particle counters were operated at 1 Hz for 8 days during the Iruvai monsoon in February 2018. Sand traps were deployed to estimate sand flux and island topography and vegetation cover were surveyed using UAV (un-manned aerial vehicle) photogrammetry and a laser level (in 2017 and 2018). Flow over beach scarps is modelled using computational fluid dynamics. Maaodegalaa sand cay reaches just 0.9 m above the highest spring high tides. Nebkha, between 0.10 and 0.40 m high, are widespread and are associated with Scaevola taccada and Cyperus conglomeratus. Between 2017 and 2018 the eastern section of the sand cay accreted 0.3 m following Cyperus colonisation. Reptation and aeolian ripple development occurred during fieldwork when near-surface flows exceeded 6 ms(-1). Saltation occurred at higher wind speeds (8 ms(-1)). The highest rates of sand transport occurred during north-east incident winds of 12 ms(-1) (at 6 m), that were probably generated by surface-based density currents under cumulonimbus clouds. Spatially, higher rates of sand transport were recorded downwind of a beach scarp, probably forced by flow acceleration. We propose a conceptual model of lagoon island formation, with both over-wash and aeolian sedimentation contributing to island accretion. A period of aeolian sedimentation may be critical to the emergence of sand cays."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999961853027344}], "status": "success"}

In this paper, we present a method that leverages the distributed nature of the autonomous traffic to provide improved traffic throughput while maintaining strict capacity constraints across the network. Our proposed multiagent-based dynamic traffic management strategy borrows concepts from both air traffic control and highway metering lights. We introduce controller agents whose actions are to adjust the robots' perceived costs of traveling across different parts of the traffic network. This approach allows each robot the flexibility of using its own (potentially proprietary) navigation algorithm, while still being bound by the rules of the road. The control policies of the agents are defined as neural networks whose weights are learned via cooperative coevolution across the entire traffic management team.

A depot, a set of pickup stations, and an autonomous delivery fleet are given. Customers dynamically order goods to a preferred pickup station and expect fast service. The goods need to be delivered from the depot to the preferred pickup station or another pickup station in the close neighborhood. Autonomous vehicles are directly dispatched between the depot and the stations.

Refuel stations support drones along their long routes between the launch stations and demand points. To account for the different levels of the facilities, a multi-level facility location approach is utilized. Moreover, the non-deterministic nature of the problem is tackled using fuzzy variables.

Recent studies have reported pathological abnormalities in oligodendrocytes in human patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a mouse model of ALS expressing the G93A mutation of the human superoxide dismutase 1 (mtSOD1). However, it is unclear whether oligodendrocyte pathology in ALS represents the primary dysfunction induced by mtSOD1 and how mtSOD1 contributes to oligodendrocyte degeneration and ALS pathogenesis. We analyzed GAL4-VP16-UAS transgenic zebrafish selectively expressing mtSOD1 in mature oligodendrocytes. We observed that mtSOD1 directly induced oligodendrocyte degeneration by disrupting the myelin sheath and downregulating monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), thereby causing spinal motor neuron degeneration. Pathological changes observed in this transgenic zebrafish were similar to the pathology observed in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS, which is characterized by expression of mtSOD1 in all cells. In addition, oligodendrocyte dysfunction induced by mtSOD1 was associated with anxiety-related behavioral abnormalities, learning impairments, and motor defects in the early symptomatic stage. We also found that treatment with potassium channel inhibitors rescued behavioral abnormalities without rescuing MCT1 expression, suggesting that myelin disruption induces behavioral abnormalities independently of MCT1. These results indicate that mtSOD1-induced dysfunction of mature oligodendrocytes is sufficient to induce motor neuron degeneration, thus informing future therapeutic strategies targeted at oligodendrocytes in ALS."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999959468841553}], "status": "success"}

However, recently, the potential uses and applicability of unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly known as drones) in civilian application domains are becoming a fast-growing phenomenon. A flying ad hoc network is a wireless ad hoc network specifically designed for the communication of unmanned aerial vehicles. Multicast routing is one of the vital aspects in wireless ad hoc networks. Using multicast transmission approaches, flying ad hoc network applications may need to send the same message to a specific group of flying nodes. The multicast communication approaches can benefit flying ad hoc network applications in conserving the scarce resources of flying nodes. Research works have been proposed to tackle the challenges in multicast routing with multi-hop communication in ad hoc network environments. Nevertheless, the conventional multicast routing mechanisms incur excessive control message overhead when a large number of nodes experience frequent topological changes. A scalable geographic multicast routing mechanism, which specially require localized operation and reduced control packet overhead, is necessary. Multicast routing in flying ad hoc networks is extremely challenging because of the dynamic topology changes and network disconnection resulted from frequent mobility of nodes. In this article, we present and implement a scalable and predictive geographic multicast routing mechanism in flying ad hoc networks. In uniform and random deployment scenarios, the MATLAB-based evaluation result has revealed that when the communication range increases, the probability of finding one-hop predicted forwarders to reach multicast destinations also increases.

Accurate estimation of the number of strawberry flowers and their distribution in a strawberry field is, therefore, imperative for predicting the coming strawberry yield. Usually, the number of flowers and their distribution are estimated manually, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. In this paper, we develop an automatic strawberry flower detection system for yield prediction with minimal labor and time costs. The system used a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) equipped with an RGB (red, green, blue) camera to capture near-ground images of two varieties (Sensation and Radiance) at two different heights (2 m and 3 m) and built orthoimages of a 402 m(2) strawberry field. The orthoimages were automatically processed using the Pix4D software and split into sequential pieces for deep learning detection. A faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), a state-of-the-art deep neural network model, was chosen for the detection and counting of the number of flowers, mature strawberries, and immature strawberries. The mean average precision (mAP) was 0.83 for all detected objects at 2 m heights and 0.72 for all detected objects at 3 m heights. We adopted this model to count strawberry flowers in November and December from 2 m aerial images and compared the results with a manual count. The average deep learning counting accuracy was 84.1% with average occlusion of 13.5%. Using this system could provide accurate counts of strawberry flowers, which can be used to forecast future yields and build distribution maps to help farmers observe the growth cycle of strawberry fields."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999963045120239}], "status": "success"}

Online retailers and delivery companies such as Amazon, are already filing up patents for the development of multi-level fulfilment centres for unmanned aerial vehicles or drone-beehives that would allow the deployment of this technology within built environment. A substantial amount of research has been carried out in the last years on the potential use of drones for parcel delivery, principally in the area of logistic optimisation.

This paper presents a modelling framework using EU-wide high-resolution population and land-use data to estimate the potential optimal location of drone-beehives based on economic viability criterion. It estimates the potential number of EU28 citizens that could potentially benefit from last mile-drone delivery services under four scenarios. The performed analyses indicates that under the scenario considered as the most technologically realistic, up to 7% of EU citizens could get access to such services. When considering technological improvements scenarios, the share reaches 30%. Furthermore, results suggest that due to the differences in population and land-use patterns in the different Member States, the potential drone coverage across Europe could be very heterogeneous, with the UK, Germany, Italy and France appearing as the most likely countries where drone-beehives may have the most efficient development."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999868869781494}], "status": "success"}

This study will examine the second proposed hypothesis through a multi-platform analysis, combining in-situ passive microwave and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. UAV image analysis shows a negative relationship between surface elevation and sediment concentration. Comparing this with observed T-B shows that horizontally polarized emissions are the most sensitive to rougher ice surfaces with 19 and 37 GHz T-B decreasing rapidly with increased incidence angle. At a 55 degrees incidence angle, 89 GHz offers the greatest potential for discriminating sea ice surfaces influenced by sediment presence, as T-B are greater in both polarizations in comparison with non-sediment-laden ice.

Furthermore, the first Pareto front obtained by the INSGA-II is improved by a post-optimisation component. Computational results validate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm.

Here we report that BIND also effectively inhibits GGGGCC repeat-mediated neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo. When fused with a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein of the HIV, TAT-BIND reduces cell death, formation of GGGGCC RNA foci, and levels of poly-GR, poly-GA, and poly-GP dipeptide proteins in cell models of C9ORF72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS-FTD). We showed that TAT-BIND disrupts the interaction between GGGGCC RNA and nucleolin protein, restores rRNA maturation, and inhibits mislocalization of nucleolin and B23, which eventually suppresses nucleolar stress in C9ALS-FTD. In a Drosophila model of C9ALS-FTD, TAT-BIND suppresses retinal degeneration, rescues climbing ability, and extends the lifespan of flies. In contrast, TAT-BIND has no effect on UAS-poly-glycine-arginine (poly-GR)(100)-expressing flies, which generate only poly-GR protein toxicity, indicating BIND ameliorates toxicity in C9ALS-FTD models via a (r)(GGGGCC)(exp)-dependent inhibitory mechanism.

Examples include unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless sensor nodes, smart beacons, and wearable health objects. Such resource-constrained devices include Active Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) nodes, and these are used to illustrate our proposal.

For manned EVs, range anxiety is still perceived as a major issue and recent surveys have shown that one-third of potential European users are deterred by this problem when considering the move to an EV. A similar consideration applies to aerial EVs for commercial use, where a careful planning of the flying range is essential not only to guarantee the service but also to avoid the loss of the EVs due to charge depletion during the flight. Therefore, route planning for EVs for different purposes (range estimation, route optimization) and/or application scenarios (terrestrial, aerial EVs) is an essential element to foster the acceptance of EVs as a replacement of traditional vehicles. One essential element to enable such accurate planning is an accurate model of the actual power consumption.

Our objective is to maximize the minimum average data collection rate from all SNs subject to a prescribed reliability constraint for each SN by jointly optimizing the UAV communication scheduling and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory. Different from the existing works that assume the simplified line-of-sight (LoS) UAV-ground channels, we consider the more practically accurate angle-dependent Rician fading channels between the UAV and SNs with the Rician factors determined by the corresponding UAV-SN elevation angles. However, the formulated optimization problem is intractable due to the lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter termed effective fading power that characterizes the achievable rate given the reliability requirement in terms of outage probability. To tackle this difficulty, we first approximate the parameter by a logistic (\"S\" shape) function with respect to the 3D UAV trajectory by using the data regression method. Then, the original problem is reformulated to an approximate form, which, however, is still challenging to solve due to its non-convexity.

The latter two subproblems are shown to be non-convex, while locally optimal solutions are obtained for them by using the successive convex approximation technique.

A considerable number of works have studied different aspects of drone package delivery service by a supplier, one of which is delivery planning. However, existing works addressing the planning issues consider a simple case of perfect delivery without service interruption, e.g., due to accident, which is common and realistic. Therefore, this paper introduces the joint ground and aerial delivery service optimization and planning (GADOP) framework. The framework explicitly incorporates uncertainty of drone package delivery, i.e., takeoff and breakdown conditions. The GADOP framework aims to minimize the total delivery cost, given practical constraints, e.g., travelling distance limit. Specifically, we formulate the GADOP framework as a three-stage stochastic integer programming model. To deal with the high complexity issue of the problem, a decomposition method is adopted. Then, the performance of the GADOP framework is evaluated by using two data sets including the Solomon benchmark suite and the real data from one of the Singapore logistics companies. The performance evaluation clearly shows that the GADOP framework can achieve significantly lower total payment than that of the baseline methods, which do not take uncertainty into account."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999860525131226}], "status": "success"}

Four different turbulence models for low-Reynolds-number flow are compared with the experimental data for a NACA 0018 airfoil over a range of two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional (3-D) conditions. The turbulence models under consideration are the k-omega shear-stress transport (SST) model with low-Reynolds-number modification, (k-omega SST) gamma-Re theta model along with its simplified version in the form of the (k-omega SST) gamma model, and k-kl-omega model. The NACA 0018 profile is rotated in a flow with a chord-based Reynolds number of 3x105 at three different rotational speeds between an angle of attack of 0 and 25 deg. Using a curve fitting methodology, an estimate of the results at an infinitesimally slow rotation can be made.

This coastline is adjacent to a gravel spit accommodating several culturally significant sites and is the logistical base for the Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island Territorial Park operations. In this study we sought to (i) assess short-term coastal erosion dynamics over fine temporal resolution, (ii) evaluate short-term shoreline change in the context of long-term observations, and (iii) demonstrate the potential of low-cost lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (\"drones\") to inform coastline studies and management decisions. We resurveyed a 500 m permafrost coastal reach at high temporal frequency (seven surveys over 40 d in 2017). Intra-seasonal shoreline changes were related to meteorological and oceanographic variables to understand controls on intra-seasonal erosion patterns. To put our short-term observations into historical context, we combined our analysis of shoreline positions in 2016 and 2017 with historical observations from 1952, 1970, 2000, and 2011. In just the summer of 2017, we observed coastal retreat of 14.5 m, more than 6 times faster than the long-term average rate of 2.2 +/- 0.1 ma(-1) (1952-2017). Coastline retreat rates exceeded 1.0 +/- 0.1 md(-1) over a single 4 d period. Over 40 d, we estimated removal of ca. 0.96 m(3) m(-1) d(-1). These findings highlight the episodic nature of shoreline change and the important role of storm events, which are poorly understood along permafrost coastlines.

Field survey data are typically collected as point clouds that are often converted to gridded raster datasets and the ultimate choice of grid resolution is left to the user. This choice may have important implications for both the quantification and interpretation of geomorphic change. Here we used concurrent topographic data collected by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry to quantify the influence of grid resolution and sampling technique on (a) the sediment budget and (b) the presence and role of geomorphic processes (i.e., alluvial, colluvial, aeolian, and fluvial transport) driving topographic change at four sites along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. We found that while both techniques produced similar estimates for site-scale sediment budgets, the magnitude of detected topographic change was dampened at coarser pixel resolutions. An overall decrease in the areal extent of erosion and deposition were observed, respectively, when coarsening pixel size from 5 cm to 1 m among all sites. Coarser resolution data tended to affect interpretation of landscape change along the margins of river valleys. For example, when changing from 5 cm to 1 m pixel resolution, the inferred contribution of aeolian changes to total site-scale geomorphic change increased in area by 7.9%, whereas the inferred contribution of alluvial and colluvial processes decreased in area by 97.9% and 88.2%, respectively. More generally, we found that coarsening pixel sizes disproportionately attributed geomorphic change to one or more of the most common processes operating at a site. We also found that coarsening pixel resolution amplified the net sediment imbalance at the site scale, driving the imbalance at erosional sites further into erosion and vice versa for depositional sites. Our results have implications both for point cloud data collection and for raster dataset processing. We argue that selecting the finest obtainable resolution is not always warranted to accurately quantify and interpret geomorphic change, because remote sensing technique, topographic data resolution, and analysis procedure can be optimized to capture the spatial scale of those processes driving landscape change. However, in landscapes at or near sediment equilibrium (i.e., equal amounts of erosion and deposition), the finest obtainable topographic data resolution is warranted to avoid amplifying sediment imbalance and erroneously inferring that sites are trending toward erosion or deposition.

The thickness of the debris layer is a key control of the melt rate of those glaciers, yet little is known about the relative importance of the three potential sources of debris supply: the rockwalls, the glacier bed and the lateral moraines. In this study, we hypothesize that mass movement from the lateral moraines is a significant debris supply to debris-covered glaciers, in particular when the glacier is disconnected from the rockwall due to downwasting. To test this hypothesis, eight high-resolution and accurate digital elevation models from the lateral moraines of the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in Nepal are used. These are created using structure from motion (SfM), based on images captured using an unmanned aerial vehicle between May 2013 and April 2018. The analysis shows that mass transport results in an elevation change on the lateral moraines with an average rate of - 0.31 +/- 0.26 m year(-1) during this period, partly related to sub-moraine ice melt. There is a higher elevation change rate observed in the monsoon (-0.39 +/- 0.74 m year(-1)) than in the dry season (-0.23 +/- 0.68 m year(-1)). The lower debris aprons of the lateral moraines decrease in elevation at a faster rate during both seasons, probably due to the melt of ice below. The surface lowering rates of the upper gullied moraine, with no ice core below, translate into an annual increase in debris thickness of 0.08 m year(-1) along a narrow margin of the glacier surface, with an observed absolute thickness of approximately 1 m, reducing melt rates of underlying glacier ice.

Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength.

This population is confined to a small, 5 ha area within a highly dynamic alluvial fan in the Bavarian Alps. We used the data acquired by UAV to monitor stream channel dynamics, to quantify bedload transport, erosion and deadwood structures and to characterize vegetation cover and height with the aim of identifying types and loss of habitats and consequently estimating extinction risk. The results show a highly dynamic stream channel and considerable bedload transport and erosion between flood events. The majority of the remaining C. chondrilloides population is found on terraces which are prone to erosion and escape habitats are missing. Between 2016 and 2017 we documented a loss of almost 25% of the species' potential habitats due to erosion events. Three percent of the existing population was lost to those events. Substantial spread of the species was only at the edge terrace which is subject to a high risk of extinction. Our study further demonstrates that many important parameters for the implementation of evidence-based conservation can be easily and cost-effectively derived from standard RGB images taken by UAVs and GIS software. As a consequence, we encourage the increased use of UAVs for restoration and monitoring practice."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999963045120239}], "status": "success"}

Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things, how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of interest."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999876022338867}], "status": "success"}

A multidisciplinary approach was used to investigate the site including geological and geomorphological surveys, together with the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), digital photogrammetric analysis, hydrodynamic modelling and C-14 AMS datings. Measurements of boulder position, elevation, size, shape and density were fed into hydrodynamic equations that are used to estimate the minimum storm and tsunami wave height required to enable the accumulation of boulders. Biogenic marine carbonate encrustations observed on 14 boulders suggest the infra- and sublittoral zones as source areas, while for most of the boulders a subaerial origin is hypothesised. The boulder deposit occurs on a flat promontory where the topography, together with the stratified limestone bedding planes and dense joint pattern constitute the predisposing factors for boulder size and detachment.

This paper provides severalmethods to determine howherbicide use has changed over timein an agricultural community in Oregon that switched over to no-till in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

By using these methods, this study shows where streamvegetation health continues to be an issue in the agricultural community, and where concentrations of a commonly used herbicide in the community may be impacting human and ecological health. This study has important implications for impacts to soil and water quality over time in agricultural communities, as many researchers have noted the need to determine the long term effects of conversion to no-till and other forms of conservation agriculture.

Time from collapse to defibrillation is essential for survival. As emergency medical services (EMS) response times in Sweden have increased, novel methods are needed to facilitate early treatment. Unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e. drones) have potential to deliver automated external defibrillators (AED). The aim of this simulation study was to explore bystanders' experience of a simulated OHCA-situation where a drone delivers an AED and how the situation is affected by having one or two bystanders onsite. Methods: This explorative simulation study used a mixed methodology describing bystanders' experiences of retrieving an AED delivered by a drone in simulated OHCA situations. Totally eight participants were divided in two groups of bystanders a) alone or b) in pairs and performed CPR on a manikin for 5 minutes after which an AED was delivered by a drone at 50m from the location. Qualitative data from observations, interviews of participants and video recordings were analysed using content analysis alongside descriptive data on time delays during bystander interaction. Results: Three categories of bystander experiences emerged: 1) technique and preparedness, 2) support through conversation with the dispatcher, and 3) aid and decision-making. The main finding was that retrieval of an AED as delivered by a drone was experienced as safe and feasible for bystanders. None of the participants hesitated to retrieve the AED; instead they experienced it positive, helpful and felt relief upon AED-drone arrival and were able to retrieve and attach the AED to a manikin. Interacting with the AED-drone was perceived as less difficult than performing CPR or handling their own mobile phone during T-CPR. Single bystander simulation introduced a significant hands-off interval when retrieving the AED, a period lasting 94s (range 75s-110s) with one participant compared to 0s with two participants. Conclusion: The study shows that it made good sense for bystanders to interact with a drone in this simulated suspected OHCA. Bystanders experienced delivery of AED as safe and feasible. This has potential implications, and further studies on bystanders' experiences in real cases of OHCA in which a drone delivers an AED are therefore necessary."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The study area, located in the northern Yucatan peninsula, is characterized by low-energy, high-angle waves, which drive a persistent (westward) alongshore sediment transport (O(10(4)) m(3)/year). High-resolution real-time kinematics global positioning system (GPS) beach surveys were conducted over a one-year period (2017-2018) to investigate the performance of LCDBs at three sites. Moreover, unmanned aerial vehicle flights were employed to evaluate far-field shoreline stability. Field observations revealed a distinct behavior in the three study sites, dependent on the breakwaters' transmission characteristics, geometry, stability, and shoreline orientation. Impermeable LCDBs, made of sand-filled geosystems, induced significant beach accretion (erosion) in up-(down-)drift areas. On the other hand, permeable LCDBs, made of Reef Ball modules, induced moderate beach changes and small erosion in down-drift areas owing to higher transmission coefficients. Measurements of LCDBs' freeboard height show that sand-filled geosystems' breakwaters presented a significant loss of sand during the study period, which explains the unexpected beach morphodynamic response on the lee side of the structure.

However, Lagrangian diagnostics can be time-consuming to calculate and often rely on weather forecasts that may not be completely accurate. Recently, Eulerian diagnostics have been developed which can provide indications of LCS and have computational advantages over their Lagrangian counterparts. In this paper, a methodology is developed for estimating local Eulerian diagnostics from wind velocity data measured by a single fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) flying in a circular arc. Using a simulation environment, driven by realistic atmospheric velocity data from the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model, it is shown that the Eulerian diagnostic estimates from UAS measurements approximate the true local Eulerian diagnostics and also predict the passage of LCSs.

The formation of dunes, as well as their sudden destruction as a result of violent storms, affects this balance in a significant way. Moreover, the growth of vegetation on the top of the dunes strongly influences the consequent growth of the dunes themselves. This work presents the results obtained through a long-term monitoring of a complex dune system by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Six different surveys were carried out between November 2015 and December 2017 in the littoral of Rosolina Mare (Italy). Aerial photogrammetric data were acquired during flight repetitions by using a DJI Phantom 3 Professional with the camera in a nadiral arrangement. The processing of the captured images consisted of the reconstruction of a three-dimensional model using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Each model was framed in the European Terrestrial Reference System (ETRS) using GNSS geodetic receivers in Network Real Time Kinematic (NRTK). Specific data management was necessary due to the vegetation by filtering the dense cloud. This task was performed by both performing a slope detection and a removal of the residual outliers. The final products of this approach were thus represented by Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the sandy coastal section. In addition, DEMs of Difference (DoD) were also computed for the purpose of monitoring over time and detecting variations. The accuracy assessment of the DEMs was carried out by an elevation comparison through especially GNSS-surveyed points. Relevant cross sections were also extracted and compared. The use of the Structure-from-Motion approach by UAVs finally proved to be both reliable and time-saving thanks to quicker in situ operations for the data acquisition and an accurate reconstruction of high-resolution elevation models.

To test their feasibility in characterizing the properties and dynamics of fast ice, three flights were carried out in the 2016-2017 austral summer during the 33rd Chinese National Antarctic Expedition (CHINARE), focusing on the area of the Prydz Bay in East Antarctica. Three-dimensional models and orthomosaics from three sorties were constructed from a total of 205 photos using Agisoft PhotoScan software. Logistical challenges presented by the terrain precluded the deployment of a dedicated ground control network; however, it was still possible to indirectly assess the performance of the photogrammetric products through an analysis of the statistics of the matching network, bundle adjustment, and Monte-Carlo simulation. Our results show that the matching networks are quite strong, given a sufficient number of feature points (mostly > 20,000) or valid matches (mostly > 1000). The largest contribution to the total error using our direct georeferencing approach is attributed to inaccuracies in the onboard position and orientation system (POS) records, especially in the vehicle height and yaw angle. On one hand, the 3D precision map reveals that planimetric precision is usually about one-third of the vertical estimate (typically 20 cm in the network centre). On the other hand, shape-only errors account for less than 5% for the X and Y dimensions and 20% for the Z dimension. To further illustrate the UAS's capability, six representative surface features are selected and interpreted by sea ice experts.

To cater with remote sensing applications, people often employ vehicles to transport, launch, and recycle them. The so-called vehicledrone cooperation (VDC) benefits from both the far driving distance of vehicles and the high mobility of UAVs. Efficient routing and scheduling can greatly reduce time consumption and financial expenses incurred in VDC. However, previous works in vehicle-drone cooperative sensing considered only one drone, thus unable to simultaneously cover multiple targets distributed in an area.

Comparing equivalent products of different data capture methods is critical as differences in errors and sampling biases between the two methods may produce different outputs, effecting further analysis. The sampling biases and errors related to SfMp and TLS lead to differences in the point clouds produced by each method. The metrics derived from the point clouds are therefore likely to differ, potentially leading to different inputs for entrainment threshold models, different trends in surface layer development being identified and different trajectories for physical processes and habitat quality being predicted. This paper provides a direct comparison between TLS and SfMp surveys of an exposed gravel bar for three different survey periods following inundation and reworking of the bar surface during high flow events. The point clouds derived from the two methods are used to describe changes in the character of the surface layer between bar inundation events, and comparisons are made with descriptions derived from conventional pebble counts. The results found differences in the metrics derived using each method do exist, but the grid resolution used to detrend the surfaces and identify spatial variations in surface layer characteristics had a greater impact than survey method. Further research is required to understand the significance of these variations for quantifying surface texture and structure and for predicting entrainment thresholds and transport rates."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999964237213135}], "status": "success"}

It is based on probabilisticMMaircraft trajectory prediction. Conflict detection is performed through the use of predicted probability of conflict (PC). An improved algorithm for estimating PC is proposed and compared with a commonly used method. Conflict resolution (CR) is formulated as a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) problem subject to a constraint on the predicted PC to guarantee safety of the optimized CR trajectories. The cost function to be minimized is tailored to the CR problem and includes the cost of performing evasive maneuvers as well as the average cost incurred by extra travel distance to the destination due to the maneuvers. An efficient algorithm for finding the optimal path (maneuver sequence), with respect to the maneuver cost, is proposed and extended to an overall CDR optimization algorithm for the total cost, in order to produce optimized conflict-free CR trajectories. The proposed search algorithm is essentially a generalization of an optimal list Viterbi algorithm (for unconstrained minimization through a trellis) to the constrained case of our MPC-based CDR problem.

However, the localization of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in urban areas experiences the notorious multipath effect and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception which could potentially generate approximately 50 meters of positioning error. This misleading localization result can be hazardous for UAV applications in GNSS-challenged areas. Due to multipath complexity, there is no general solution to eliminate this effect. A solution to guide UAV operation is to plan an optimal route that smartly avoids the area with a strong multipath effect. To achieve this goal, the impact of the multipath effect in terms of positioning error at different locations must be predicted. This paper proposes to simulate the reflection route by a ray-tracing technique, aided by predicted satellite positions and the widely available 3D building model. Thus, the multipath effect in the pseudorange domain can be simulated using the reflection route and multipath noise envelope according, according to specific correlator designs. By constructing the multipath-biased pseudorange domain, the predicted positioning error can be obtained using a least square positioning method. Finally, the predicted GNSS error distribution of a target area can be further constructed. A new A* path planning algorithm is developed to combine with the GNSS error distribution. This paper designs a new cost function to consider both the distance to the destination and the positioning error at each grid. By comparing the conventional and the proposed path planning algorithms, the planned paths of the proposed methods experienced fewer positioning errors, which can lead to safer routes for UAVs in urban areas."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999721050262451}], "status": "success"}

A wide deployment of VANETs is possible only after addressing numerous research challenges. One of the most complicated issues consists of designing a routing strategy, taking into consideration several serious constraints, and especially in a network such as VANET. The severity of these issues would be increased significantly when a VANET is deployed over an urban area, where we distinguish the high mobility of nodes and existing obstructions (e.g., buildings, bridges, tunnels, etc.).

Vegetation changes over large areas are traditionally monitored by linking plot-scale measurements to satellite data. However, integrating field and satellite data is not straightforward. Typically, the satellite data are at a much coarser scale in comparison to field measurements. Here, we studied how Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) can be used to bridge this gap. We covered three 250 m x 250 m sites in Fennoscandian tundra with varying productivity ana FCover, ranging from barren vegetation to shrub tundra. The UAS sites were then used to train satellite data-based FCover models. First, we created a binary vegetation classification (absent, present) by using UAS-derived RGB-orthomosaics and logistic regression. Secondly, we used the classification to calculate FCover to Planet CubeSat (3 m), Sentinel-2A MSI (10 m, 20 m), and Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) grids, and examined how well FCover is explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VI) derived from satellite data. The overall classification accuracies for the UAS sites were >= 90%. The UAS-FCover were strongly related to the tested VIs (D-2 89% at best). The explained deviance was generally higher for coarser resolution data, indicating that the effect of data resolution should be taken into account when comparing results from different sensors. VIs based on red-edge (at 740 nm, 783 nm), or near-infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) had the highest performance. We recommend wider inspection of red-edge and SWIR bands for future Arctic vegetation research. Our results demonstrate that UASs can be used for observing FCover at multiple scales.

The objective is to demonstrate that logarithmic sprayers, which automatically make a logarithmic dilution of a herbicide rate, can extract biologically relevant parameters describing the efficacy of herbicides in crops, and compare localities and time of assessment. RESULTS In a conventional and an organic field, canola, white mustard, and no crop plots were sprayed with diflufenican and beflubutamid. A mixed effect log-logistic dose-response regression, with autoregressive correlation structure, estimated ED50 and ED90 for visual and Excess Green Index symptoms at various days after treatment (DAT). For visual assessment, ED50 differed within no crop between locations for beflubutamid at 12 DAT and 26 DAT. For diflufenican, the ED50 was different within crops at the two fields at 12 DAT, but not at 26 DAT. The Excess Green Indices at ED50 were not different among herbicides, locations, and corps; ED90 differed for white mustard and canola for beflubutamid but not for diflufenican.

Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques and application of a depth-brightness model are used to produce a series of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) at low and near-bankfull flows. A number of technical and image processing challenges are described that arise from the application of SfM in dry and submerged environments. A model for best practice is presented and analysis suggests a depth-brightness model approach can represent the different scales of bedforms present in sandy braided rivers with low-turbidity and shallow (< 2 m deep) water. The aerial imagery is used to quantify the spatial distribution of unit bar and dune migration rate in an 18 km reach and three 1 km long reaches respectively. Dune and unit bar migration rates are highly variable in response to local variations in planform morphology. Sediment transport rates for dunes and unit bars, obtained by integrating migration rates (from UAV) with the volume of sediment moved (from DSMs using MAV imagery) show near-equivalence in sediment flux. Hence, reach-based sediment transport rate estimates can be derived from unit bar data alone. Moreover, it is shown that reasonable estimates of sediment transport rate can be made using just unit bar migration rates as measured from 2D imagery, including from satellite images, so long as informed assumptions are made regarding average bar shape and height. With recent availability of frequent, repeat satellite imagery, and the ease of undertaking repeat MAV and UAV surveys, for the first time, it may be possible to provide global estimates of bedload sediment flux for large or inaccessible low-turbidity rivers that currently have sparse information on bedload sediment transport rates.

The Jinglingxi watershed, covering 20.5 km(2), was selected as the study area. The changes in pond number, surface area, and drainage catchment were analyzed with aid of high-resolution typographical map and unmanned aerial vehicles imagery. The spatial WaTEM/SEDEM model was developed to simulate watershed soil erosion and sediment deposition under the absence and presence of water bodies scenarios. Results from different simulation scenarios were compared and revealed the napping effects of the multi-pond system. From 1983 to 2016, the number and total area of ponds roughly doubled.

This is problematic in inaccessible or hazardous field environments, including highly crevassed glaciers, where implementing suitable GCP networks would be logistically difficult if not impossible. To overcome this challenge, we present an alternative geolocation approach known as GNSS-supported aerial triangulation (GNSS-AT). Here, an on-board carrier-phase GNSS receiver is used to determine the location of photo acquisitions using kinematic differential carrier-phase positioning. The camera positions can be used as the geospatial input to the photogrammetry process. We describe the implementation of this method in a low-cost, custom-built UAV and apply the method in a glaciological setting at Store Glacier in western Greenland. We validate the technique at the calving front, achieving topographic uncertainties of +/- 0.12 m horizontally (similar to 1.1 x the ground sampling distance) and +/- 0.14 m vertically (similar to 1.3 x the ground sampling distance), when flying at an altitude of similar to 450 m above ground level. This compares favourably with previous GCP-derived uncertainties in glacial environments and allows us to apply the SfM-MVS photogrammetry at an inland study site where ice flows at 2 m day(-1) and stable ground control is not available. Here, we were able to produce, without the use of GCPs, the first UAV-derived velocity fields of an ice sheet interior.

Where drainage is poor, formation of saline-water ponds can occur. Within East Anglian (UK) salt marshes, two types of sediment chemistries can be found beneath these ponds; iron-rich sediment, which is characterized by high ferrous iron concentration in subsurface porewaters (up to 2 mM in the upper 30 cm); and sulfide-rich sediment, which is characterized by high porewater sulfide concentrations (up to 8 mM). We present 5 years of push-core sampling to explore the geochemistry of the porewater in these two types of sediment. We suggest that when organic carbon is present in quantities sufficient to exhaust the oxygen and iron content within pond sediments, conditions favor the presence of sulfide-rich sediments. In contrast, in pond sediments where oxygen is present, primarily through bioirrigation, reduced iron can be reoxidised and thus recycled for further reduction, favoring the perpetuation of iron-rich sedimentary conditions. We find these pond sediments can alter significantly over an annual timescale. We carried out a drone survey, with ground-truthed measurements, to explore the spatial distribution of geochemistry in these ponds. Our results suggest that a pond's proximity to a creek partially determines the pond subsurface geochemistry, with iron-rich ponds tending to be closer to large creeks than sulfide-rich ponds. We suggest differences in surface delivery of organic carbon, due to differences in the energy of the ebb flow, or the surface/subsurface delivery of iron may control the distribution. This could be amplified if tidal inundations flush ponds closer to creeks more frequently, removing carbon and flushing with oxygen. These results suggest that anthropogenic creation of drainage ditches could shift the distribution of iron- and sulfide-rich ponds and thus have an impact on nutrient, trace metal and carbon cycling in salt marsh ecosystems."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

More than 30 aerosol particle collection flights were carried out near Tubingen in March 2017 at altitudes of up to 300 m above ground level (a.g.l.),each with a sampled air volume of 2m(3). Pollen grains and spores of various genera, as well as large (> 20 mu m) opaque particles and fine dust particles, were collected, and specific concentrations of up to 100 particles per m(3) were determined by visual microscopic analysis. The pollen concentration values measured with the new UAS match well with the pollen concentration data published by the Stiftung Deutscher Polleninformationsdienst (PID) and by MeteoSwiss. A major advantage of the new multicopter-based UAS is the possibility of the identification of collected aerosol particles and the measurement of their concentration with high temporal and spatial resolutions, which can be used inter alia to improve the database for modelling the propagation of aerosol particles in the ABL."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999964237213135}], "status": "success"}

Large banks migrate alongshore from the Amazon to the Orinoco delta, separated by 'inter-bank' zones. Banks dissipate waves, partially weld onshore, and are colonized by mangroves, whereas waves in inter-bank areas cause shoreline erosion, mitigated where rare cheniers develop. Cheniers assure coastal protection and recreational and ecosystem services, notably providing nesting sites for marine turtles. Cheniers are also under pressure from sand mining. In order to gain a better understanding of how these cheniers form and evolve, a study was conducted on Braamspunt beach, a major turtle-nesting chenier in Suriname constructed from sand supplied by the Maroni River. Satellite images between 1987 and 2018 show a reduction of the alongshore extent of the chenier, following sand supply cut-off from the Maroni by a mud bank migrating westward towards the mouth of the Suriname River, exacerbated by mud-blanketing of sand. Commercial sand mining has further affected the beach, but mined volumes are not known. Field surveys (high-resolution topography, drone photogrammetry, wave measurements) conducted in February, 2016 highlight two chenier types depending on sand availability, transport and wave reworking: a high-tide reflective/low-tide dissipative and longshore transport-dominated type 1 exhibiting berm scarping, and a low, overwash-dominated type 2. As the mud-bank's leading edge impinges on the inter-bank trailing edge, sand sequestering by mud and storage in type 2 washovers entail less available sand downdrift. Type 1 lost over 4200 m(3) of sand in just 3-4 days. An increasingly deficient budget induces progressive change to type 2, morphodynamically better adapted to diminution of available sand, and epitomizing chenier fragmentation and isolation within the muddy Guianas coastal plain. By affecting the morphology and sand budget of Braamspunt, these changes lower opportunities for turtle-nesting. Further reduction of the length of exposed chenier is apparently halted near the Suriname River mouth where mud is liquefied by the outflowing river and tidal jet, but the continued existence of this preserved beach could be endangered by sand mining."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The main challenge in controlling this kind of system arises from the dynamic behavior imposed by the load, which is usually coupled to the UAV by means of a rope, adding unactuated degrees of freedom to the whole system. Furthermore, to perform the load transportation it is often needed the knowledge of the load position to accomplish the task. Since available sensors are commonly embedded in the mobile platform, information on the load position may not be directly available. To solve this problem in this work, initially, the kinematics of the multi-body mechanical system are formulated from the load's perspective, from which a detailed dynamic model is derived using the Euler-Lagrange approach, yielding a highly coupled, nonlinear state-space representation of the system, affine in the inputs, with the load's position and orientation directly represented by state variables. A zonotopic state estimator is proposed to solve the problem of estimating the load position and orientation, which is formulated based on sensors located at the aircraft, with different sampling times, and unknown-but-bounded measurement noise. To solve the path tracking problem, a discrete-time mixed H-2/H-infinity controller with pole-placement constraints is designed with guaranteed time-response properties and robust to unmodeled dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances. Results from numerical experiments, performed in a platform based on the Gazebo simulator and on a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the system, are presented to corroborate the performance of the zonotopic state estimator along with the designed controller.

This study employed the new SLAM-based CSIRO \"Hovermap\" LiDAR system within a purpose-built environment as a testbed to experimentally investigate the interactive effects of fundamental UAV flight parameters on key metrics of LiDAR point clouds. Assessed within a full factorial design at both Site- and Target-levels, the UAV input variables of Pattern, ground Speed and above ground Altitude (AGL) were tested against the point cloud response variables Density, GSD and Accuracy as measured by RMSE and cloud-to-mesh Euclidian distance ('Deviation'). A novel approach is described wherein the trajectory file of each flight was examined to determine the observed values of the input and response variables, remove noise and facilitate a standardised basis of comparison. Several new terms are introduced including Sampling Effort Variable (SEV, s.m(-2)), Effective Scan Rate (ESR, pts.s(-1)) and Effective Density Rate (EDR, pts.m(-2).s(-1)) as well as an alternate approach to describe Pattern (s.m(-1)) as a scalar quantity. Reporting significant effects with all response variables at both Site- and Target-levels, the Range of the LiDAR sensor, closely associated with Altitude, presented as the single most important factor.

Those halcyon days are numbered: self-driving cars, delivery drones, networked medical devices, and other cyber-physical systems have rekindled interest in understanding how tort law will apply when software errors lead to loss of life or limb. Even after all this time, however, no consensus has emerged. Many feel strongly that victims should not bear financial responsibility for decisions that are entirely automated, while others fear that cyber-physical manufacturers must be shielded from crushing legal costs if we want such companies to exist at all.

This Article observes that no consensus is imminent as long as liability is pegged to a standard of \"crashproof' code. The added prospect of cyber-physical injury has not changed the underlying complexities of software development. Imposing damages based on failure to prevent code crashes will not improve software quality, but will impede the rollout of cyber-physical systems. This Article offers two lessons from the \"crashworthy\" doctrine, a novel tort theory pioneered in the late 1960s in response to a rising epidemic of automobile accidents, which held automakers accountable for unsafe designs that injured occupants during car crashes. The first is that tort liability can be metered on the basis of mitigation, not just prevention. When code crashes are statistically inevitable, cyber-physical manufacturers may be held to have a duty to provide for safer code crashes, rather than no code crashes at all. Second, the crashworthy framework teaches courts to segment their evaluation of code, and make narrower findings of liability based solely on whether cyber-physical manufacturers have incorporated adequate software fault tolerance into their designs. Requiring all code to be perfect is impossible, but expecting code to be crashworthy is reasonable."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.999983549118042}], "status": "success"}

The UAS was flown over the area of interest to record video, and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was then applied to analyze the image frames to retrieve the wave celerity. Using the shallow water approximation to the linear-wave dispersion relation, wave celerity from the imagery could be used to deduce the local water depth. After combining the water depth inversion at multiple points from within the area of interest, the bathymetry was constructed. To validate the method, water depths from 25 spatial points were surveyed with a total station during a trial in the nearshore surf zone at Freeport, Texas. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was estimated as 0.132 m. By minimizing the RMSE, the correction factor that accounts for the wave nonlinearity in estimating wave celerity was estimated as 1.02.

Ephemeral stream may influence soil properties, which in turn may determine biodiversity and function of an ecosystem in alluvial fan of arid desert region. Ephemeral stream is one of the most common natural disturbances, yet the effects of the ephemeral stream on plant communities in terms of species diversity and plant species distribution remain poorly studied. In this study, the information of species distribution, ephemeral stream beds ('washes'), and the characteristics of plant growth, i.e. height, crown area, were interpreted at different heights using the images of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). After that, soil properties such as soil texture (sand, silt and clay), soil water content, pH, soil organic matter, soil electric conductivity, soil bulk density and the percentage of gravel content, and their relationships with UAV data were assessed in order to explore the influences of ephemeral stream on species diversity, plant growth characteristics and species distribution in an alluvial fan of arid desert region.

Soil properties, plant height and crown area were higher in washes than that in non-washes. Plant height, crown area and the total number of individual plants increased with increasing wash width and per unit length of stream flow.

We collected 120 Hz video of running giraffes, and calibrated each video frame using metatarsal length as a constant object of scale. We tested a number of methods to measure metatarsal length. The method with the least variation used close range photography and a trigonometric equation to spatially calibrate the still image, and derive metatarsal length. In the absence of this option, a spatially calibrated surface model of the study terrain was used to estimate topographical dimensions in video footage of interest. Data for the terrain models were collected using the same equipment., during the same study period. We subsequently validated the accuracy of the UAV method by comparing similar speed measurements of a human subject running on a treadmill, with treadmill speed. At 8 m focal distance we observed an error of 8% between the two measures of speed. This error was greater at a shorter focal distance, and when the subject was not in the central field of view. We recommend that future users maximise the camera focal distance, and keep the subject in the central field of view. The studied giraffes used a grounded rotary gallop with a speed range of 3.4-6.9 ms(-1) (never cantering, trotting or pacing), and lower duty factors when compared with other cursorial quadrupeds. As this pattern might result in adverse increases in peak vertical limb forces with speed, it was notable to find that contralateral limbs became more in-phase with speed. Considering the latter pattern and the modest maximal speed of giraffes, we speculate that tissue safety factors are maintained within tolerable bounds this way. Furthermore, the angular kinematics of the neck were frequently isolated from the pitching of the body during running; this may be a result of the large mass of the head and neck.

In this paper, we assessed the capabilities of UAS-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, coupled with a river terrace detection algorithm for mapping of river terraces over a 1.9 km(2) valley of complex terrain setting, with a focus on the performance of this latest technology over such complex terrains. With the proposed image acquisition approach and SfM photogrammetry, we constructed a 3.8 cm resolution orthomosaic and digital surface model (DSM). The vertical accuracy of DSM was assessed against 196 independent checkpoints measured with a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS. The results indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 3.1cm and 2.9 cm, respectively. These encouraging results suggest that this low-cost, logistically simple method can deliver high-quality terrain datasets even in the complex terrain, competitive with those obtained using more expensive laser scanning. A simple algorithm was then employed to detect river terraces from the generated DSM. The results showed that three levels of river terraces and a high-level floodplain were identified. Most of the detected river terraces were confirmed by field observations. Despite the highly erosive nature of fluvial systems, this work obtained good results, allowing fast analysis of fluvial valleys and their comparison. Overall, our results demonstrated that the low-cost UAS-based SfM technique could yield highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution topography data over complex terrain settings, making it particularly suitable for quick and cost-effective mapping of micro to medium-sized geomorphic features under such terrains in remote or poorly accessible areas. Methods discussed in this paper can also be applied to produce highly accurate digital terrain data over large spatial extents for some other places of complex terrains."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The NPRA hired vendors to fly nine different UAS aircraft on challenging avalanche surveillance missions in cold, windy weather in steep mountains.

Data from UAS carrying visual cameras, used for both real-time viewing and photogrammetry (structure from motion), and ground penetrating radar (GPR) were compared with snow pack information collected using hand dug pits. The review team found the GPR output could identify the weak snow layers that cause avalanches but the raw data required time-consuming post-processing.

Water management in agriculture is one of the most important applications of these images. Top view images of a crop can be processed for determining the percentage of green cover (PGC), and 2D images from different viewing angles can be applied for obtaining 3D models of the crops. In both cases, the obtained data can be managed for calculating several parameters such as crop evapotranspiration, water demand, detection of water deficit and indicators about solute transport of fertilizers in the plant. For this purpose, a remote image capture system has been developed for an application in lettuce crops. The system consists of several capture nodes and a local processing base station which includes image processing algorithms to obtain key features for decision-making in irrigation and harvesting strategies. Placing multiple image capture nodes allows obtaining different observation zones that are representative of the entire crop. The nodes have been designed to have autonomous power supply and wireless connection with the base station. This station carries out irrigation and harvesting decisions using the results of the processing of the images captured by the nodes and the information of other local sensors.

The facilities serve as drone launching sites for distributing the resources. Each drone makes several one-to-one trips from the facility location to the demand points and back until the battery range is met. The planning period is short-term and therefore the recharging of drone batteries is not considered. This paper presents an integer linear programming formulation with the objective of maximizing coverage while explicitly incorporating the drone energy consumption and range constraints. The new formulation is called the Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones or simply MCFLPD. The MCFLPD is a complex problem and even for relatively small problem sizes a state of the art MIP solver may require unacceptably long running times to find feasible solutions. Computational efficiency of MCFLPD solutions is a key factor since conditions associated with customer demands or weather conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed) may change suddenly and require a fast global reoptimization. To better balance solution quality and running times novel greedy and three-stage heuristics (3SH) are developed. The 3SH is based on decomposition and local exchange principles and involves a facility location and allocation problem, multiple knapsack subproblems, and a final local random search stage. On average the 3SH solutions are within 5% of the best Gurobi solutions but at a small fraction of the running time.

The formulation of the UAV path planning is based on the idea of assigning higher priorities to the areas that are more likely to have victims. We applied the method to three illustrative cases, considering different types of disasters: a tornado in Brazil, a refugee camp in South Sudan, and a nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan. The results demonstrated that the POMDP solution achieves full coverage of disaster-affected areas within a reasonable time span. We evaluate the traveled distance and the operation duration (which were quite stable), as well as the time required to find groups of victims by a detailed multivariate sensitivity analysis. The comparisons with a Greedy Algorithm showed that the POMDP finds victims more quickly, which is the priority in humanitarian relief, whereas the performance of the Greedy focuses on minimizing the traveled distance.

Ignoring such correlation may result in limited and biased conclusions and inefficient countermeasures. Recently, the availability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides us an opportunity to collect individual vehicle's data to conduct traffic analysis at the microscopic level. Hence, this paper contributes to the literature by proposing a new framework to analyze crash risk at freeway interchange merging areas considering drivers' merging behavior. The analysis framework is conducted based on individual vehicle data from UAV videos. A multilevel random parameters logistic regression model is proposed to investigate each driver's merging behavior in the acceleration lane. The model could identify the impact of different factors related to traffic and drivers on the merging behavior. Then, the crash risk between the merging vehicle and surrounding vehicles is calculated by incorporating the time-to-collision (TTC) and the output of the estimated merging behavior's model. The results suggest that the proposed method provides more valuable insights about the crash risk at interchange merging areas by simultaneously considering the merging behavior and the safety measure. It is concluded that the merging speed, driving ability (e.g., lane change confidence, lane-keeping instability), and the merging location can affect the crash risk.

Among the geometric parameters of the serpentine nozzle, the aspect ratio (AR) at the nozzle exit is one of the most critical parameters for the nozzle design as the infrared suppression effect could be greatly enhanced with the increment of AR by strengthening the mixing between the exhaust plume and atmosphere; the aim of this paper is to study the influence of the AR on the flow characteristics of the double serpentine nozzle. The flow features of six double serpentine convergent nozzles, i.e. AR = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15 respectively, were numerically simulated with the shear stress transport kappa-omega turbulent model adopted, which had been validated by the experimental data. The characteristics of internal flow and external jet, and the aerodynamic performances of these six nozzles were compared. Results show that the Ma contours at the symmetric plane are different due to the distinct flow accelerations caused by the change of the curvature and the duct height for diverse AR, and the surface pressure and the shock wave features are different correspondingly. The lateral divergence and the lateral convergence characteristics of the nozzle configuration lead to opposite lateral flow under diverse AR, and the change of lateral width induced different lateral pressure gradient, then lead to various lateral vortex distributions. The length of potential core is the contribution of the comprehensive effects of geometry parameters, and it is decreased with the increase of AR due to the dominated effect of the increased mixing area; however, the declining rate is slowed down.

Suppression of the anodic growth of Zn dendrites is essential for resolution of these problems and requires materials with nanoscale mechanics sufficient to withstand mechanical deformation from stiff Zn dendrites. Such materials must also support rapid transport Zn2+ ions necessary for high Coulombic efficiency and energy density, which makes the structural design of such materials a difficult fundamental problem. Here, we show that it is possible to engineer a solid Zn2+ electrolyte as a composite of branched aramid nanofibers (BANFs) and poly(ethylene oxide) by using the nanoscale organization of articular cartilage as a blueprint for its design. The high stiffness of the BANF network combined with the high ionic conductivity of soft poly(ethylene oxide) enable effective suppression of dendrites and fast Zn2+ transport. The cartilage inspired composite displays the ionic conductance 10X higher than the original polymer. The batteries constructed using the nanocomposite electrolyte are rechargeable and have Coulombic efficiency of 96-100% after 50-100 charge discharge cycles. Furthermore, the biomimetic solid-state electrolyte enables the batteries to withstand not only elastic deformation during bending but also plastic deformation. This capability make them resilient to different type of damage and enables shape modification of the assembled battery to improve the ability of the battery stack to carry a structural load.

The data indicate that the level of ambient light can largely overrule the internal circadian rhythm of foraging honey bees. Furthermore, colonies with a higher need for foraging decreased their foraging activity less than satiated colonies, consistent with the hypothesis that individual foraging decisions may be influenced by colony state, which affects cost-benefit analyses. In a second experiment, the temporal dynamics of homing of released workers and drones was compared in periods before, during, and after the solar eclipse. During the totality of the eclipse, very few bees arrived back at their hive, while homing before the total eclipse was accelerated, particularly in drones. The results suggest that, while the homing abilities of honey bees are not compromised until the sun is completely eclipsed, they may still interpret the diminishing light as an indicator of deteriorating flight conditions. Our unique study provides some insight into the control of honey bee foraging behavior when external cues and internal circadian rhythms are at odds, lent support to the notion that food deprivation can lead to riskier foraging, and indicated that homing in honey bees is possible even with very small amounts of sunlight."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999959468841553}], "status": "success"}

Drone-based thermal sensors have the potential to overcome these hurdles by rapidly scanning large forested areas from above, detecting and mapping wildlife based on the contrast between their warm body temperatures and the cool tree canopies. We tested this concept by flying a drone-mounted thermal infrared radiometric sensor over the wildlife-rich rainforests of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Arboreal mammals had body temperatures around 27 degrees C and were conspicuous in the thermal infrared imagery at night and early morning when the forest canopy was cool (23-25 degrees C), but were difficult to detect by mid-morning, by which time the direct sunshine had heated up canopy vegetation to over 30 degrees C. Species were difficult to identify from thermal infrared imagery alone, but could be recognized from synchronized visual images taken during the daytime. Simultaneous drone and ground-based surveys of the same area proved that the aerial thermal camera did detect high-canopy species missed by the terrestrial observer, but that substantially more animals were detected by the human than by the drone. Because animal detection was so much better at night, when species ID was difficult, we suggest that future work could combine automated detection of animals from thermal infrared imagery with flash photography or IR illumination to enable species ID during nocturnal surveys. We conclude by discussing various logistical challenges that limit the utility of drone-based thermal infrared today, but that could be overcome by continued improvement of technology and collaboration with permitting agencies."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999964237213135}], "status": "success"}

Approximately one million new UAVs have been registered in the United States, with the majority being recreational UAVs. This growth of UAV activity and their increasingly common public presence engenders a wide variety of opinions, perceptions, and concerns among individuals about UAVs, particularly concerning personal privacy. Drawing from the privacy and emerging technology literature, the purpose of this paper is to identify how individuals' perceptions of privacy explain their attitudes on the use of UAVs and whether this aligns with what we would expect from an emerging technology. Utilizing Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for survey delivery to 2,108 respondents we conducted a descriptive statistical analysis of response frequency and t-tests of group mean differences. The results suggest that individuals who use UAVs, maintain a familiarity with the capabilities of UAVs, and have a basic understanding of UAV regulations, are somewhat less concerned about the growing presence of UAVs as it relates to privacy than individuals who are generally unfamiliar with UAVs, their capabilities, and UAV regulations.

However, due to significant mobility and highly dynamic topology, designing reliable and efficient routing protocols for FANETs is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider a network that comprises multiple flying UAVs and GSs to transfer messages by multi-hop relaying. We propose a routing protocol, named course-aware opportunistic routing for FANETs (CORF). The UAVs cooperatively exchange aeronautical data with others. The source UAV node (SUN) calculates the transfer probabilities to different neighbors by jointly considering the positions of its neighbors and the destination node. Based on the direction information and the transfer probabilities, the SUN selects the next-hop relay nodes among the neighbor UAVs and GSs. This process continues until the destination node receives the message. The simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed CORF protocol achieves significant performance superiority as compared with the traditional protocols in terms of message delivery rate and network latency."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999774694442749}], "status": "success"}

Gaza is a landstrip within the Palestinian territories and the home of 2 million people. The median age in Gaza is 17.2 years and almost half of the population is below the age of 14 years. We studied the prevalence and severity of extremity amputation injuries caused by drone strikes compared with those caused by other explosive weapons among patients with amputations attending the main physical prosthesis and rehabilitation centre in Gaza. Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we recruited patients from the Artificial Limb and Polio Centre (ALPC) in Gaza city in the Gaza strip with conflict-related traumatic extremity amputations. Patients were eligible if they had one or more amputations sustained during a military incursion in Gaza during 2006-16 and had an available patient record. Each patient completed a self-reporting questionnaire of the time and mechanism of injury, subsequent surgeries, comorbidities, and their socioeconomic status, and we collected each patient's medical history, recorded the anatomical location of their amputation or amputations, and interviewed each patient to obtain a detailed description of the incursion or incursions that led to their amputation injury. We classified the severity of amputations and number of subsequent surgeries on ordinal scales and then we determined the associations between these outcomes and the mechanism of explosive weapon delivery (drone strike vs other) using ordinal logistical regression. Findings We collected data on 254 patients from APLC who had sustained an amputation injury. Of these patients, 234 (92%) were male and 43 (17%) were aged 18 years or younger at the time of injury. The age of participants was representative of the Gaza population, with a median age at inclusion was 28 years (IQR 23-33), and the median age at the time of injury was 23 years (IQR 20-29). 136 (54%) amputation injuries were caused by explosive weapons delivered by drone strikes, with explosives delivered by tanks being the next most common source of amputation injury (28 [11%]). Adjusted for age and sex, drone-delivered weapons caused significantly more severe injuries than explosives delivered by other mechanisms (eg, military jet airplanes, helicopters, tank shelling, and naval artillery; odds ratio [OR] 2.50, 95% CI 1.52-4.11; p=0.0003). Compared with all other types of weapons, the patients whose injuries were caused by drone strikes needed significantly more subsequent surgical operations to treat their amputation injuries than those injured by other weapons (OR 1.93, 1.19-3.14; p=0.008). Interpretation Drone strikes were the most commonly reported cause of amputation injury in our study population and were associated with more severe injuries and more additional surgeries than injuries caused by other explosive weapons. Limitations of our study include the self-reported nature of the mechanism of injury and number of subsequent surgeries and selection bias from not incorporating amputation injuries from individuals who died immediately or due to complications. The increasing use of drones needs to be addressed, rather than passively accepted, by the international community. This study fills a gap in our knowledge of the civilian consequences of modern warfare and we believe it is also relevant to the growing populations that are being exposed to drone warfare and for health-care personnel treating these people.

However, incidents and accidents can, and increasingly do, happen. Traditional investigations of aircraft incidents require on-board flight data recorders (FDRs); however, these physical FDRs only work if the drone can be recovered. A further complication is that physical FDRs are too heavy to mount on light drones, hence not suitable for forensic digital investigations of drone flights. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive software architecture, LiveBox, to make drones both forensic-ready and regulation compliant. We studied the feasibility of using distributed technologies for implementing the LiveBox reference architecture. In particular, we found that updates and queries of drone flight data and constraints can be treated as transactions using decentralised ledger technology (DLT), rather than a generic time-series database, to satisfy forensic tamper-proof requirements. However, DLTs such as Ethereum, have limits on throughput (i.e. transactions-per-second), making it harder to achieve regulation-compliance at runtime. To overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive reporting algorithm to dynamically reduce the precision of flight data without sacrificing the accuracy of runtime verification. Using a real-life scenario of drone delivery, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves a 46% reduction in bandwidth without losing accuracy in satisfying both tamper-proof and regulation-compliant requirements."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999936819076538}], "status": "success"}

It has been used to collect and analyze the real-time data remotely in all Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Since the IIoT environment gathers and transmits the data over insecure public networks, a promising solution known as authentication and key agreement (AKA) is preferred to prevent illegal access. In the medical industry, the Internet of Medical Things (IoM) has become an expert application system. It is used to gather and analyze the physiological parameters of patients. To practically examine the medical sensor-nodes, which are imbedded in the patient's body. It would in turn sense the patient medical information using smart portable devices.

However, the detection, tracking, and geolocation of moving vehicle based on the airborne platform suffer from small object sizes, complex scenes, and low-accuracy sensors. To address these problems, this paper develops a framework for moving vehicle detecting, tracking, and geolocating based on a monocular camera, a GPS receiver, and inertial measurement units (IMUs) sensors. First, the method based on YOLOv3 was employed for vehicle detection due to its effectiveness and efficiency for small object detection in complex scenes. Then, a visual tracking method based on correlation filters is introduced, and a passive geolocation method is presented to calculate the GPS coordinates of the moving vehicle. Finally, a flight control method in terms of the previous image processing results is introduced to lead the UAV that is following the interesting moving vehicle. The proposed scheme has been built on a DJI M100 platform on which a monocular camera and a microcomputer Jetson TX1 are added.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted as a modulation scheme for this communication system to combat fading. Unfortunately, because of possible high UGV speed, the orthogonality between subcarriers in OFDM signals is prone to intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by the Doppler spread. This paper discusses ICI suppression analysis using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 under several Harbor transmission scenarios. Such communication links may contain line of sight (LoS) components in transmission. The channel is thus modeled as the well-known fast time varying path loss model. Furthermore, this paper derives the signal to interference ratio (SIR) and evaluates this parameter for several types of fading and Doppler spread shapes in UGV channels. Additionally, the paper presents a practical method for calculating the spectral efficiency of OFDM systems, with an example for actual implementation in UGV systems. Eventually, the testbed results indicate that the SIR will decrease if the maximum Doppler spread expands. In the Rician channel, it can be seen that the SIR depends on the maximum Doppler speed, the angle of arrival (AoA), and even the Rician element of the LoS component."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999955892562866}], "status": "success"}

Routing in flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) with UAVs is a challenging issue because of the high speed and sudden changes in direction of UAVs. Traditional routing protocols in FANETs periodically send hello messages for the establishment and maintenance of the routes. However, sending hello messages periodically after a fixed interval increases bandwidth wastage when the hello interval is excessively short or causes long delays in neighbour discovery when the hello interval is overly long. Moreover, several disconnected UAV groups have been observed in which the group members are connected among themselves but detached from the main network. By exchanging excessive hello messages inside the group, the UAVs maintain an unnecessary neighbourhood, causing wastage of energy. However, FANETs have certain advantages, such as knowledge about mission-related information. To solve the problem of unnecessary energy drain, we propose a novel adaptive hello interval scheme of energy efficient hello (EE-Hello)-based on available mission-related information, such as the volume of the allowed airspace, number of UAVs, UAV-transmission range, and UAV speed. We present a method to decide the distance that a UAV needs to travel before sending a hello message. We also specify a technique to determine the number of UAVs necessary to achieve specific network requirements, such as packet delivery ratio or throughput, with the expenditure of minimum energy.

FANETs are composed of several UAVs that cooperate to accomplish some critical mission (i.e., hazardous area monitoring). In order to maintain UAVs coordination, all UAVs must continuously retransmit or relay messages through the wireless channel to assure that every UAV knows the FANET condition. However, when this message exchange is done arbitrarily, it may cause the broadcast storm problem, leading the wireless medium to an inoperable state. Despite some efforts reported in the literature for providing general broadcast storm problem mitigation techniques, the challenge of aggregating new information/knowledge to receivers, instead of just spreading the information in the network, has received less attention. In this paper, we not only prove that broadcast storm problem causes network contention as the number of UAVs increases but also propose the innovative dynamic neighborhood-based algorithm for the broadcast storm problem (DNA-BSP), which was developed and validated based on the outdoor experiments and computer simulations. It can mitigate the broadcast storm problem, which is a real challenge in FANETs, reducing message redundancy in more than 98%, and making message delivery more than 95% faster than in flooding scenario, outperforming classical broadcast storm mitigation techniques when applied in FANETs.

However, the dense deployment of conventional static base stations (SBSs) is not always economical, for example, when periods of peak load are short and infrequent. In such cases, several flying base stations (FlyBSs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles can be seen as a convenient substitution for the dense deployment of SBSs. This paper focuses on maximization of user satisfaction with provided data rates. To this end, we propose an algorithm that associates users with the most suitable SBS/FlyBS and finds optimal positions of all FlyBSs. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of two proposed approaches for the joint association and positioning based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). It is shown that both solutions improve the satisfaction of users with provided data rates in comparison with a competitive approach. We also demonstrate trade-offs between the GA and the PSO.

Bi, Cd, Tl, Se, Sb, Te and Au are the most enriched metals and metalloids in the particulate phase of volcanic plumes. Observations of the particulate phase from the volcanic plumes of White Island, Yasur and Etna reveal abundant silicates and sulfates, sulfuric acid and more interestingly Zn oxide containing variable amounts of Cu. Thermodynamic speciation calculations show chloride species to be very important in terms of gaseous metal transport. Complexation with sulfur, in contrast, appears significant only in S-rich and Cl-poor gases, at high (>700 degrees C) temperature. Bromine, despite being a minor component of volcanic gases, is very efficient at complexing with metals, and especially with Cu, Pb, Bi, Zn and Cr. Metal emission rates in the study period at White Island are one to two orders of magnitude lower than reported previously, with similar to 6-10 kg/d of Cu, As, Se and Zn, and <2 kg/d of Pb, Bi, Tl, Sb, Te and Cd. Higher values were measured at Yasur volcano, ranging from similar to 175 kg/d of Cu, similar to 30 kg/d of As, Zn and Pb, and similar to 3 kg/d of Tl and Cd. Such fluxes of toxic metals are significant, representing a potential threat for local populations.

An evaluation of this approach was conducted with empirically generated results regarding signal quality and cellular coverage-illustrating the potential of using unmanned ultra-low altitude aerial vehicles to deliver 5G cellular mobile services.

However, refrained by limited battery capacities, the hovering time of UAVs is still limited, impeding them from achieving remote tasks, such as wide area inspection. To deal with such long-range applications, a common sense solution is to employ vehicles to transport, launch, and recycle UAVs. Efficient routing and scheduling for UAVs and vehicles can greatly reduce time consumption and financial expenses incurred in long-range inspection. Nevertheless, prior works in vehicle-assisted UAV inspection considered only one UAV, and was incapable of concurrently serving multiple targets distributed in an area. Leveraging multiple UAVs to serve multiple targets in parallel can significantly enhance efficiency and expand service areas. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which supports the cooperation of one vehicle and multiple drones for wide area inspection applications.

An explicit expression to describe the relationship among the states of followers, the time-varying formation for the leaders and the formation reference is derived. It is shown that the states of followers not only converge to the convex hull formed by those of leaders but also keep certain formation specified by the convex combination of the formation for the leaders. Moreover, an approach to determine the gain matrices of the formation-containment protocol is proposed by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Finally, a formation-containment platform with five quadrotor UAVs is introduced, and both the simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. Note to Practitioners-This paper addresses the problem of formation-containment control for multi-UAV systems over directed topologies. In practical applications, there may exist multiple leaders and multiple followers in a multi-UAV system. Formation-containment means that the states of leaders form the desired time-varying formation and at the same time the states of the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. Formation-containment control provides a unified framework for formation control and containment control, and has potential applications in the cooperative source seeking, load transportation, and surveillance.

The advent of autonomous drones has initiated serious challenges, including how to maintain their safe operation during their missions. The safe operation of UAVs remains an open and sensitive issue since any unexpected behavior of the drone or any hazard would lead to potential risks that might be very severe. The motivation behind this work is to propose a methodology for the safety assurance of drones over the Internet (Internet of drones (IoD)). Two approaches will be used in performing the safety analysis: (1) a qualitative safety analysis approach and (2) a quantitative safety analysis approach. The first approach uses the international safety standards, namely, ISO 12100 and ISO 13849 to assess the safety of drone's missions by focusing on qualitative assessment techniques. The methodology starts with hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and finally draws the safety recommendations associated with a drone delivery use case. The second approach presents a method for the quantitative safety assessment using Bayesian networks (BN) for probabilistic modeling. BN utilizes the information provided by the first approach to model the safety risks related to UAVs' flights. An illustrative UAV crash scenario is presented as a case study, followed by scenario analysis, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

They represent an innovative mean to complement existing technologies to surveil transportation network, control traffic, and monitor incidents. The UAVs usually operate for time-limited missions due to their limited battery capacity. Hence, they need to frequently return to their docking stations to recharge their batteries, which handicaps their mission coverage and performance. When designing a UAV-based ITS infrastructure, it is crucial to leverage the UAV fleet effectively. In this paper, a generic management framework of UAVs for ITS applications is developed. The problem of docking/charging station placement is first investigated to find optimized locations for a given number of stations to be installed by the ITS operator. To this end, two fundamental criteria are taken into account: i) the flying time required by the UAV to reach the mission/incident location and ii) the risk of battery failure during the UAV operation. The two algorithms, namely a penalized weighted k-means algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, are designed for this purpose. Once the docking stations are placed, a UAV scheduling program is formulated to optimally cover the pre-known missions while minimizing the total energy consumption of the fleet and respecting a coverage efficiency targeted by the ITS operator.

However, there is a paucity of comprehensive surveys on aeronautical channel modeling in line with the specific aeronautical characteristics and scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on reviewing the air-to-ground (A2G), ground-to-ground (G2G), and air-to-air (A2A) channel measurements and modeling for UAV communications and aeronautical communications under various scenarios. We also provide the design guideline for managing the link budget of UAV communications taking account of link losses and channel fading effects.

In such a trend, detecting vehicles and extracting traffic parameters from UAV video in a fast and accurate manner is becoming crucial in many prospective applications.

For this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs and latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed, which ensures full coverage for a given space with a minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from an optimal transport theory. The simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs compared with the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency compared with the SINR-based association.

Although A-star algorithm is usually used to solve this problem due to its fast computational time, it may suffer from some drawbacks, for instance, there are too many unnecessary inflection points and redundant nodes during its moving process. For this reason, the improved A-star algorithm is proposed to optimize the motion path, including the reduction of path length, number of AGV turns and path planning time. In this scheme, a key point selection strategy is used for the secondary planning based on the initial path obtained by the A-Star algorithm. Therefore, redundant inflection points and nodes in the path can be effectively removed. Additionally, the rotation direction and rotation angle of AGV at the inflection point can be thus determined.

One critical decision for planners is whether to elevate structures or place them on the snow surface. For planners wishing to minimize the impact of drifting, elevated structures are generally more desirable, with the tradeoff of added construction cost. Surface-based structures are less expensive to construct, but accumulate drift more rapidly than their elevated counterparts, thus incurring an added recurring expense of snow removal. To estimate this added cost, we quantified the volume of snow drifted on several structures at Summit, Greenland, using structure-frommotion photogrammetry from a small UAV. We find that while the elevated \"Bighouse\" accumulated negligible drift, the surface-based \"Greenhouse\" accumulated 4862 +/- 444 m (3) of snow. We then use estimates of equipment efficiency at snow removal coupled with equipment operating cost to determine the time and cost of snow removal (69 +/- 6 h for the Greenhouse). Finally, we analyze a 10-year record of winds from Summit, and estimate the total amount of snow drifted on the structures in any given year. We estimate that the Greenhouse at Summit accumulates an average of 11,702 m (3) of snow per year, and that clearing that snow costs an average of $41,000 per year. The expense of snow removal for surface-based structures should be factored into the total lifetime cost of the building, making elevated structures much more cost-competitive than they may initially appear."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999963045120239}], "status": "success"}

The QTEC is classified as a critical engineering and transportation corridor and is connected to both inland China and the Tibetan Plateau. The engineering infrastructures over the QTEC are distributed around two slopes. A high-accuracy FARO Focus3D X130 3D laser scanner, nine Trimble 5700 GNSS systems and a DJI Inspire 1 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system were used to generate a 3D surface model for the slopes. The deployment of the GNSS datum points (GDPs), GNSS control points (GCPs), a reference sphere set and a set of rectangular white-black cardboards used as registration reference targets (RRTs) enhanced the capacity for data collection, registration and preprocessing of the TLS point cloud. The mapping changes of the slopes based on the TLS data were used to examine the 3D surface topography dynamics during different time periods. Soil temperature and moisture sensors were also adopted to monitor the water and heat exchange for one of the slopes, which can reveal the effects of the hydrothermal process on slope deformation during freeze-thaw cycles. This occurred mainly because the phase transitions initiated slope deformation due to water and heat transfer. The two slopes exhibited mainly thaw slumping during thawing periods and frost heaving during the freezing period, but the frost heaving was dominant after several freeze-thaw cycles. The implementation of TLS and hydrothermal measurement technologies allow for a better understanding and assessment of hazards related to slopes adjacent to engineering and transportation corridors, and this will provide guidance for the future of highway and high-speed railway design and construction along the QTEC.

In this study, models at the single-cell level have been used to simulate the corresponding polarization curves on flight conditions, which constitutes a contribution to the use of fuel cells in UAV. After validating these models, several cases of interest relating to UAV operation have been considered, such as cruise flight at different altitudes and horizontal flight when crossing clouds, to compare the performance of both types of fuel cells. Fuel cell temperature has been controlled to avoid high performance degradation. The results show that the effects of atmospheric flight conditions are more important for PEMFC/H-2 than for DMFCs.

However, orchard yields are often still based on an extrapolation of tree production which is visually assessed on a limited number of trees; a tedious and inaccurate task that gives no yield information at a finer scale than the orchard plot. In this work, we propose a method to accurately map individual tree production at the orchard scale by developing a trade-off methodology between mechanistic yield modelling and extensive fruit counting using machine vision systems. A methodological toolbox was developed and tested to estimate and map tree species, structure, and yields in mango orchards of various cropping systems (from monocultivar to plurispecific orchards) in the Niayes region, West Senegal. Tree structure parameters (height, crown area and volume), species, and mango cultivars were measured using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and geographic, object-based image analysis. This procedure reached an average overall accuracy of 0.89 for classifying tree species and mango cultivars. Tree structure parameters combined with a fruit load index, which takes into account year and management effects, were implemented in predictive production models of three mango cultivars. Models reached satisfying accuracies with R-2 greater than 0.77 and RMSE% ranging from 20% to 29% when evaluated with the measured production of 60 validation trees. In 2017, this methodology was applied to 15 orchards overflown by UAV, and estimated yields were compared to those measured by the growers for six of them, showing the proper efficiency of our technology. The proposed method achieved the breakthrough of rapidly and precisely mapping mango yields without detecting fruits from ground imagery, but rather, by linking yields with tree structural parameters. Such a tool will provide growers with accurate yield estimations at the orchard scale, and will permit them to study the parameters that drive yield heterogeneity within and between orchards."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The ultrasonic anemometers were used to collect simultaneous measurements of wind speed, wind direction, and temperature in a fixed triangle pattern; each sensor was located at one apex of a triangle with similar to 100 to 200 m on each side, depending on the experiment. A WRF-LES model was used to determine the wind field across the sampling domain. Data from the ground-based sensors and the two UASs were used to detect attracting regions (also known as Lagrangian Coherent Structures, or LCSs), which have the potential to transport high concentrations of agents. This unique framework for detection of high concentration regions is based on estimates of the horizontal wind gradient tensor. To our knowledge, our work represents the first direct measurement of an LCS indicator in the atmosphere using a team of sensors. Our ultimate goal is to use environmental data from swarms of sensors to drive transport models of hazardous agents that can lead to real-time proper decisions regarding rapid emergency responses. The integration of real-time data from unmanned assets, advanced mathematical techniques for transport analysis, and predictive models can help assist in emergency response decisions in the future."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999961853027344}], "status": "success"}

This highly flexible solution allows building an ad-hoc aerial network based on a backbone of relaying UAVs.

Thus, we propose a caching device-to-device (D2D) scheme for small-cell networks, in which caching placement and D2D establishment are combined. In this scheme, a limited cache is equipped at each user, and the popular files can be prefetched at the local cache during off-peak period. Thus, dense D2D connections can be established during peak time aided by these cached users, which will reduce the backhaul pressure significantly. To do this, first, an optimal caching scheme is formulated according to the popularity to maximize the total offloading probability of the D2D system. Thus, most edge users can obtain their required video files from the caches at users nearby, instead from the small-cell base station. Then, the sum rate of D2D links is analyzed in different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Furthermore, to maximize the throughput of D2D links with low complexity, three D2D-link scheduling schemes are proposed with the help of bipartite graph theory and Kuhn-Munkres algorithm for low, high, and medium SNRs, respectively.

The concentrations of most ions on the above ground level were higher than that on the ground surface during the sampling period. The measurements of the total ion concentrations were approximately 54 to 26% of the PM2.5 mass concentrations on the ground surface. The concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- decreased with increases in the height from the ground, which may be related to the influence of the vehicle emissions and human activities. NO2- and SO42- both had a peak concentration on the higher vertical altitude at night in the sea-land wind system.

The vertical distribution of ionic concentrations and wind field provided information concerning changes in pollutant transport and source regions that affect the local air quality. The ACME mounted in UAVs is the feasible and convenient method to fast understand the vertical distributions of aerosol chemical species. It provides important information about the accumulation and diffusion effects by the boundary layer variation to aerosol characteristics, which is difficulty observed from the conventional ground-based measurements.

Debris flow is responsible for enormous damage across large areas. This makes debris flow simulations a crucial means of determining whether to issue an evacuation warning for area residents. For safety purposes, restricted areas are designated around volcanos during eruptions, making it difficult to gather information (such as the amount and permeability of ash) required for precise debris flow simulations. An unmanned observation system, intended for use in such restricted areas, was developed to address this issue. The proposed system is based on a multirotor micro-unmanned aerial vehicle (MUAV) that transports cameras, small devices to measure target environments, and a small robot to active volcanic areas. Several field tests were performed around active volcanoes for validation and system improvement. This study investigates five unmanned systems with field tests. The first one is an autonomous flight to collect three-dimensional (3D) terrain information. The MUAV conducted the long flight at Mt. Unzen-Fugen and evaluated the accuracy and calculation time of the developed 3D terrain model. The second one is a drop-down-type ash-depth measurement scale. The scales were deployed at Mt. Unzen-Fugen and confirmed its function. The third system is a soil-sampling device to estimate permeability. The device is hung from the MUAV by a long tether and collects soil and gravels directly with two rollers, while the MUAV is hovering. Indoor experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the device, and field experiments were conducted to confirm the validation of the system in different volcanic environments. The fourth system is an unmanned surface flow measurement device to estimate permeability. The device carries a water balloon and breaks it when it lands on the ground.

The past works in the field of AMs consider the multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as the base and manipulators with rigid links as the interactive elements with the environment which are bulky and heavy. To overcome the issue, this paper introduces the AMs endowed with flexible manipulators, their dynamic modeling, a new method for trajectory planning and control algorithm such that the unfavorable effects of using flexible elements like vibrations are minimized. Due to lack of kinematic constraints and the presence of flexibility conditions, conventional methods of trajectory planning for ground wheeled-mobile manipulators (GWMMs) such as extended and augmented Jacobian matrix cannot be applied to AMs. The addition of flexibility to the manipulator increases underactuation degrees (UADs), the complexity of trajectory planning and control synthesis. Considering large deformation assumption for flexible links, the dynamic equations and their induced nonholonomic constraints are derived applying Lagrangian formulation. Then, these constraints with that part of equations of motion corresponding to the links flexibility are solved simultaneously in the context of an optimization algorithm resulting in optimized trajectories.

Aircraft manufactures and engineers have been putting significant effort into the design process to lower the cost of development and time to a minimum. In terms of flight tests and aircraft certification, implementing simulation and virtual test techniques may be a sufficient method in achieving these goals. In addition to simulation and virtual test, a derivative design can be implemented to satisfy different market demands and technical changes while reducing development cost and time. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a derivative design optimization was applied to Expedition 350, a small piston engine powered aircraft developed by Found Aircraft in Canada. A derivative that changes the manned aircraft to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for payload delivery was considered. An optimum configuration was obtained while enhancing the endurance of the UAV. The multidisciplinary design optimization module of the framework represents the optimized configuration and additional parameters for the simulator. These values were implemented in the simulator and generated the aircraft model for simulation. Two aircraft models were generated for the flight test. Findings - The optimization process delivered the UAV derivative of Expedition E350, and it had increased endurance up to 21.7 hours. The original and optimized models were implemented into virtual flight test. The cruise performance exhibited less than 10 per cent error on cruise performance between the original model and Pilots Operating Handbook (POH). The dynamic stability of original and optimized models was tested by checking Phugoid, short period, Dutch roll and spiral roll modes. Both models exhibited stable dynamic stability characteristics. Practical implications - The original Expedition 350 was generated to verify the accuracy of the simulation data by comparing its result with actual flight test data. The optimized model was generated to evaluate the optimization results. Ultimately, the virtual flight test framework with an aircraft derivative design was proposed in this research.

The proposed methodology is described by taking an example of a VTOL Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for a mission requirement of carrying and delivering 6 kg payload to a destination at 16 km from the point of origin. First, the design of proprotors is carried out using a physics based modified Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) analysis, which is validated using experimental data generated for the purpose. Proprotors have conflicting requirement for optimal hover and forward flight performance and a compromise solution has to be chosen. Next, the biplane wings are designed using simple lifting line theory. The airframe design is followed by power plant selection and transmission design. Finally, weight estimation is carried out to complete the design process. The proprotor design with 24 degrees preset angle and -24 degrees twist is found to be suitable for the current mission profile, based on 70% weightage to forward flight and 30% weightage to hovering flight conditions.

In this work 29 rotary and fixed-wing UAV surveys were conducted during multiple field campaigns, totaling 47 flights and over 14.3 km(2), to document permafrost thaw subsidence impacts on or close to road infrastructure in the Northwest Territories, Canada. This paper provides four case studies: (1) terrain models and orthomosaic time series revealed the morphology and daily to annual dynamics of thaw-driven mass wasting phenomenon (retrogressive thaw slumps; RTS). Scar zone cut volume estimates ranged between 3.2 x 10(3) and 5.9 x 10(6) m(3). The annual net erosion of RTS surveyed ranged between 0.35 x 10(3) and 0.39 x 10(6) m(3). The largest RTS produced a long debris tongue with an estimated volume of 1.9 x 10(6) m(3). Downslope transport of scar zone and embankment fill materials was visualized using flow vectors, while thermal imaging revealed areas of exposed ground ice and mobile lobes of saturated, thawed materials. (2) Stratigraphic models were developed for RTS headwalls, delineating ground-ice bodies and stratigraphic unconformities. (3) In poorly drained areas along road embankments, UAV surveys detected seasonal terrain uplift and settlement of up to 0.5 m (>1700 m(2) in extent) as a result of injection ice development. (4) Time series of terrain models highlighted the thaw-driven evolution of a borrow pit (6.4 x 10(5) m(3) cut volume) constructed in permafrost terrain, whereby fluvial and thaw-driven sediment transfer (1.1 and 3.9 x 10(3) m(3) a(-1) respectively) was observed and annual slope profile reconfiguration was monitored to gain management insights concerning site stabilization. Elevation model vertical accuracies were also assessed as part of the case studies and ranged between 0.02 and 0.13 m Root Mean Square Error. Photogrammetric models processed with Post-processed Kinematic image solutions achieved similar accuracies without ground control points over much larger and complex areas than previously reported. The high resolution of UAV surveys, and the capacity to derive quantitative time series provides novel insights into permafrost processes that are otherwise challenging to study.

During the event, large amounts of wood clogged and damaged a bridge of a cycling path at the outlet of the Grimmbach, while the town of Braunsbach was devastated by discharge and material transported along the Orlacher Bach. The severity of the event in these two small catchments (30.0 km(2) and 5.95 km(2), respectively) is remarkable in basins with a relatively low average slope (10.7 and 12.0%, respectively). In order to gain a better understanding of the driving forces during this flood event an integrated approach was applied including (i) an estimate of peak discharges, (ii) an analysis of changes in channel width by comparing available aerial photographs before the flood with a post-flood aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and validation with field observations, (iii) a detailed mapping of landslides and analysis of their connectivity with the channel network and finally (iv) an analysis of the amounts of large wood recruited and deposited in the channel. The morphological changes in the channels can be explained by hydraulic parameters, such as stream power and unit stream power, and by morphological parameters such as the valley confinement. This is similar for LW recruitment amounts and volume of exported LW since most of it comes from the erosion of the valley floor. The morphological changes and large wood recruitment and deposit are in the range of studied mountain rivers. Both factors thus need to be considered for mapping and mitigating flash flood hazards also in this kind of low range mountains. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Under this general framework, two UAV operation scenarios are considered: periodic operation, where the UAV serves the GUs in a periodic manner by following a certain trajectory repeatedly, and one-time operation where the UAV serves the GUs with one single fly and then leaves for another mission. In each scenario, we aim to minimize the UAV periodic flight duration or mission completion time, while satisfying the target data requirement of each GU via a joint UAV trajectory and communication resource allocation design approach. Iterative algorithms are proposed to find efficient locally optimal solutions by utilizing successive convex optimization and block coordinate descent techniques. Moreover, as the quality of the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithms critically depends on the initial UAV trajectory adopted, we propose new methods to design the initial trajectories for both operation scenarios by leveraging the existing results for solving the classic Traveling Salesman Problem and Pickup-and-Delivery Problem.

The goal of this paper was to analyze the effectiveness of drones as supplemental bridge inspection tools. In pursuit of this goal, the selected bridge for inspection was a three-span glued-laminated timber girder with a composite concrete deck located near the city of Keystone in the state of South Dakota (SD). A drone, a Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) Phantom 4, was utilized for this study. Also, an extensive literature review to gain knowledge on current bridge inspection techniques using drones was conducted. The findings from the literature review served as the basis for the development of a five-stage drone-enabled bridge inspection methodology. A field inspection utilizing the drone was performed following the stages of the methodology, and the findings were compared to current historical inspection reports provided by the SD Department of Transportation (SDDOT). Quantified data using the drone such as a spalled area of 0.18 m(2), which is identical to the measurement provided by the SDDOT (0.3 m by 0.6 m), demonstrated the efficiency of the drone to inspect the bridge.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are utilized as message ferries with an on-the-fly mobility decision making. The multi-hop delivery of messages is enabled by efficient message forwarding and replication among UAVs to accelerate the delivery of messages. Due to lack of global knowledge in UAVs, decisions in a UAV are made based on local observations. To this end, a signaling among UAVs occurs when they visit each other on-the-air. Through signaling, a UAV updates its view from the network and applies this information to its decision makers. Trajectory aware and priority based message replication schemes are proposed in this paper to limit the number of message replications and to decrease the delay of message delivery. The results show that the multi-hop delivery of messages in a message ferry network by message forwarding and replication among UAVs accelerates the delivery of messages comparing with a pure message ferrying scheme without any message forwarding. The proposed trajectory aware message replication scheme performs as good as the unlimited message replication scheme while decreasing the buffer length in UAVs.

In this study, we collected visible and multispectral images with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and introduce a comprehensive methodology and workflow to extract lodging features from UAV imagery. We use statistical methods to screen several potential feature factors (e.g., texture, canopy structure, spectral characteristics, and terrain), and construct two nomograms (i.e., Model-1 and Model-2) with better validation performance based on selected feature factors. Model-2 was superior to Model-1 in term of its discrimination ability, but had an over-fitting phenomenon when the predicted probability of lodging went from 0.2 to 0.4. The results show that the nomogram could not only predict the occurrence probability of lodging, but also explore the underlying association between maize lodging and the selected feature factors.

The transportation of these valuable resources greatly depends on pipelines; however, pipeline leakages have huge economic and environmental impacts warranting an effective operational methodology for pipeline monitoring. We proposed a method for mapping soil contamination due to pipeline leakage in Dixonville, Alberta, Canada. In particular, very high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and electromagnetic induction (EM) surveying data were analyzed using a hierarchical object-based random forest (RF) algorithm. In level-1 classification, a land cover map was produced using UAV data. Next, all land cover classes, excluding contaminated soil, were masked out. In level-2 classification, the contaminated soil class was further partitioned into three subclasses representing varying degrees of contamination. Specifically, we proposed a salinity index, named the normalized salinity index, to detect areas of soil contamination. The salinity index proposed herein, as well as several other salinity indices and UAV bands, were used as input features for level-2 classification.

Before the experiments, the position of the detector mounted on a UAV that was minimally disturbed by the rotation of the rotors was analyzed based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The combined analysis indicated that the surface meteorological conditionshigh relative humidity, low wind speed, and low temperaturewere conducive to the accumulation of PM2.5. Strongly intense temperature inversion layers and the low thickness of the atmospheric mixed layer could have resulted in elevated PM2.5 mass concentrations. In the early stage, air pollution was affected by the synoptic circulation of the homogenous pressure field and low wind speeds, and the pollutants mainly originated from emissions from surrounding areas. The aggravated pollution was mainly attributed to the cold front and strong northwesterly winds above 850 hPa, and the pollutants mostly originated from the long-distance transport of emissions with northwesterly winds, mainly from the BeijingTianjinHebei (BTH) region and its surrounding areas. This long-distance transport predominated during this event. The air pollution level and aerosol optical depth (AOD) were positively correlated with respect to their spatial distributions; they could reflect shifts in areas of serious pollution. Pollution was concentrated in Anhui Province when it was alleviated in Nanjing. Polluted dust, polluted continental and smoke aerosols were primarily observed during this process. In particular, polluted dust aerosols accounted for a major part of the transport stage, and existed between the surface and 4 km.

In this paper, we extend these results to scenarios in which the set of attacked nodes can change over time. We formulate this secure estimation problem into the classical error correction problem (Candes and Tao, 2005) and we show that accurate decoding can be guaranteed.

The method of unmanned aircraft aerial photographs fixation also encounters difficulties because there are no stable clear objects and contours that enable to link aerial photographs, to determine the boundaries of captured territory and to ensure the accuracy of surface measurements.

{"original_data": {"PT": "J", "TI": "Crowd-Based Learning of Spatial Fields for the Internet of Things From harvesting of data to inference", "AB": "The knowledge of spatial distributions of physical quantities, such as radio-frequency (RF) interference, pollution, geomagnetic field magnitude, temperature, humidity, audio, and light intensity, will foster the development of new context-aware applications. For example, knowing the distribution of RF interference might significantly improve cognitive radio systems [1], [2]. Similarly, knowing the spatial variations of the geomagnetic field could support autonomous navigation of robots (including drones) in factories and/or hazardous scenarios [3]. Other examples are related to the estimation of temperature gradients, detection of sources of RF signals, or percentages of certain chemical components. As a result, people could get personalized health-related information based on their exposure to sources of risks (e.g., chemical or pollution). We refer to these spatial distributions of physical quantities as spatial fields. All of the aforementioned examples have in common that learning the spatial fields requires a large number of sensors (agents) surveying the area [4], [5]. A common way to sense environmental variables is the deployment of dedicated wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which continues to stimulate fertile research activities in the scientific community. Typical WSN applications are oriented to sense specific physical quantities (e.g., temperature) in well-defined areas [6], [7]. Unfortunately WSNs are generally characterized by significant constraints in terms of deployment cost, energy limitation, and the need for maintenance. These constraints prevent them from becoming scalable and therefore from being the ultimate solution for automated and distributed sensing of the physical world. The expected pervasive diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (fixed and mobile) opens up a unique opportunity for a wide and massive sensing and mapping (i.e., georeferencing of physical quantities). In fact, the IoT constitutes a paradigm where a multitude of heterogeneous devices is able to sense the environment, process data, and actuate, thus creating the necessary infrastructure for cyberphysical systems. This infrastructure galvanizes technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, smart cities, and intelligent transportation [8], [9]. From the extensive variety of applications of the IoT, we are interested in those that will benefit from having a spatial coverage of a wide area due to a large number of agents navigating through it. For instance, this can be the case when devices are carried by people or autonomous agents (e.g., vehicles, robots, or drones) moving in outdoor-and indoor-populated environments like malls, stadiums, or crowded buildings. One can even imagine cities at large, if one considers much larger settings in size. Thanks to the widespread diffusion of IoT devices with heterogeneous sensors, the estimation of spatial physical fields is creating a new trend for next-generation sensor networks, referred to as mobile crowdsensing networks [10]-[13]. This is basically a zero-effort approach to automatically collect and process data. Recently, as an example, this concept has been proposed for zero-effort automatic mapping of environmental features using sensors already embedded in smartphones, such as magnetometers and Wi-Fi [14]-[17]. In such settings, the contribution of the agent to the sensing process is as simple as carrying the personal device in a pocket while the individual is moving around. Individuals are not even requested to be participatory, as the sensing process could run in the background during the normal operation of the device. In other words, agents are aware of the background sensing process, but they are not participatory in the sense that they are not requested to follow particular paths to make the learning process more effective. Thus, the sensing process is not an exclusive task, and it arises from the dynamic reality of humans or autonomous agents. The sensing process is a result of piggybacking on the capabilities of today's and future wireless personal devices. Including data generated by these devices will dramatically increase the amount of data for sensing and mapping purposes, with obvious benefits in terms of the resulting accuracy. In this context, the IoT is the technological enabler for crowdsensing and learning of spatial fields. Interestingly, IoT devices are, in general, able to communicate among themselves, either directly or through a fusion node that can potentially be in the cloud. Thanks to communication capabilities, empirical data gathered by mobile agents (the crowd) can be collected and processed by learning algorithms located in the cloud. These algorithms exploit the correspondence between the position and the value of the physical quantity measured in that position to estimate the spatial field. As a consequence, positioning and spatial field estimation are intimately intertwined, as will be illustrated in the \"Sensing and Positioning\" section. Crowdsourcing-based learning methods rely on the experience gained by previous agents. In principle, it is possible that, with crowd-based learning, one can perform optimal information fusion [10]. On the other hand, moving from the well-controlled conditions of WSN scenarios, where nodes are deployed in ad hoc known locations, to crowdsensing settings, where agents move around in an uncontrolled manner, entails a number of issues that need to be addressed. The methods rely on sharing through cloud mechanisms [18], but they can be of practical relevance in IoT applications only if their computational and memory requirements do not grow with the amount of collected data. Therefore, novel methodologies for multisensor data fusion and information processing are needed. They should guarantee efficient statistical representation of spatial fields and a computational complexity that does not depend on the number of measurements. Further, the algorithms need to be robust against irregular positioning and measurement errors."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system (MLS/MMS)-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense LiDAR point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the ALS-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classification of ultra-dense MLS data, a new method for the semantic labeling of LiDAR data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classifiers are used to determine the fine deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence (WofE) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classification results from the MLS and ALS data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classification accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution.

A small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS; a remotely operated airplane) was used in a coordinated effort with the USV to collect microorganisms on agar media 50 m above the surface of the water. Samples from the USV and sUAS were cultured on selective media to estimate concentrations of culturable microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). Concentrations of microbes from the sUAS ranged from 6 to 9 CFU/m(3) over saltwater, and 12 to 16 CFU/m(3) over freshwater (over 10-min sampling intervals) at 50 m above ground level (AGL). Concentrations from the USV ranged from 0 (LOD) to 42,411 CFU/m(3) over saltwater, and 0 (LOD) to 56,809 CFU/m(3) over freshwater (over 30-min sampling intervals) in air near the water surface. Particle concentrations recorded onboard the USV ranged from 0 (LOD) to 288 mu g/m(3) for PM1, 1 to 290 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5, and 1 to 290 mu g/m(3) for PM10. A general trend of increasing concentration with an increase in particle size was recorded by each sensor. Through laboratory testing, the collection efficiency of the 3D-printed impingers was determined to be 75% for 1 mu m beads and 99% for 3 mu m beads. Additional laboratory tests were conducted to determine the accuracy of the miniaturized optical particle counters used onboard the USV. Future work aims to understand the distribution of bioaerosols above aquatic environments and their potential association with cloud formation and precipitation processes."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

In this study, we focus on finding an effective delivery route for trucks carrying drones. To put it concretely, we propose a new approach on a nonlinear programming model to find shift-weights that move the centers of clusters to make for wider drone-delivery areas along shorter truck-route after initial K-means clustering and TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) modeling. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model with shift-weights, we compare it with two other delivery route approaches. One is a route without shift-weights after K-means clustering and TSP modeling, and the other is a route by TSP for all delivery locations without K-means clustering. Through experimental results of paired t-tests on randomly generated delivery locations, we show that our proposed model is more effective than the other two models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To fully exploit the drones' flexibility and superiority, we propose a novel dynamic IoD collaborative communication approach for urban VANETs. Unlike most of the existing approaches, the IoD nodes are dynamically deployed based on current locations of ground vehicles to effectively mitigate inevitable isolated cars in conventional VANETs. For efficiently coordinating IoD, we model IoD to optimize coverage based on the location of vehicles. The goal is to obtain an efficient IoD deployment to maximize the number of covered vehicles, i.e., minimize the number of isolated vehicles in the target area. More importantly, the proposed approach provides sufficient interconnections between IoD nodes. To do so, an improved version of succinct population-based meta-heuristic, namely Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) inspired by food searching behavior of birds or fishes flock, is implemented for IoD assisted VANET (IoDAV). Moreover, the coverage, received signal quality, and IoD connectivity are achieved by IPSO's objective function for optimal IoD deployment at the same time. We carry out an extensive experiment based on the received signal at floating vehicles to examine the proposed IoDAV performance. We compare the results with the baseline VANET with no IoD (NIoD) and Fixed IoD assisted (FIoD). The comparisons are based on the coverage percentage of the ground vehicles and the quality of the received signal.

Such modification, however, curtails Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of networks in terms of bandwidth, media access delay, coverage and others. Alternately, directional antennas have advantages over omnidirectional antennas such as improved transmission range, spatial reuse and high throughput. Nevertheless, its introduction raises location-dependent issues to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. This calls for an efficient MAC protocol that can cater to new directional antenna models and, at the same time, can counter the constraints associated with the dynamic UAVs.

Methods: Thirty-two of the most common analytes were tested. For biochemical analytes, we used plasma collected in lithium heparin tubes with and without separator gel.

This paper proposes a priority-aware fast MAC (PF-MAC) protocol for UAV-assisted industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT) systems, ensuring fast and robust data delivery. At first, the IoT devices under the UAV communication range transmit a reservation frame to the UAV to catch transmission opportunities using CSMA/CA. The devices utilize static traffic priority and a novel adaptive backoff mechanism during CSMA/CA. After receiving the reservation frames from the IoT devices, the UAV calculates the dynamic device priority based on their static traffic priority, communication duration, sampling frequency, and remaining energy. Then, time slot is assigned by the UAV to each device for data transmission. To ensure fairness, if a device fails in contention during the CSMA/CA period, the static traffic priority is raised in the next retransmission.

However, modern analogs are pivotal in interpreting depositional processes and reducing uncertainty in evaluating the complex chronostratigraphic architecture of these landforms. Such a modern analog was provided by category 3 tropical cyclone (TC) Olwyn in 2015, which caused a significant storm surge in the Exmouth Gulf (Western Australia). Pre- and post-TC Olwyn geomorphological surveys and high-resolution drone-derived topographical data of a large washover fan document a detailed history of erosion and deposition during the event. The modern analog deposits provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate the use of luminescence-based proxies (luminescence inventories) for tracing event-related sediment source environments and understanding transport processes. Sediments deposited during Olwyn show a systematic relationship between luminescence characteristics and washover fan position. Seaward and central washover sections are indicated by well-bleached deposits due to the beach as the dominant source and/or long transport distances. Lateral washover deposits are characterized by rather local source areas and short transport distances, resulting in higher remnant ages of 70-140 a. Our data show that the combination of sediment source environments and sediment transport length across the fan represents the main control in resetting the luminescence signal and enabling reliable depositional ages to be calculated. It documents the benefit of investigating luminescence inventories when establishing chronologies from complex sedimentary records, thereby demanding a careful consideration of local processes and source areas when interpreting sedimentary TC records."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999961853027344}], "status": "success"}

This study uses a combined thermal-optic sUAS to monitor the seasonal geothermal influence of a 1-km-long reach of the Yellowstone River, paired with in-situ streambed temperature profiles to evaluate geothermal seep interactions with Yellowstone River in Montana, USA. Accurate river water surface elevation along the shoreline was estimated using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry digital surface models (DSMs); however, water surface elevations were unreliable in the main river channel. Water temperature in thermal infrared (TIR) orthomosaics was accurate in temperature ranges of tens of degrees (>approximate to 30 degrees C), but not as accurate in temperature ranges of several degrees (>approximate to 15 degrees C) as compared to in-situ water temperature measurements. This allowed for identification of geothermal features but limited the ability to identify small-scale temperature changes due to river features, such as pools and riffles. The study concludes that rivers with an average width greater than or equal to 123% of the ground area covered by a TIR image will be difficult to study using structure from motion photogrammetry, given Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) altitude restrictions and sensor field of view.

An effective task migration strategy needs to fully consider the location of users, the load status of edge servers, and energy consumption, which make designing an effective task migration strategy a challenge. In this paper, we innovatively proposed a mobile edge computing (MEC) system architecture consisting of multiple smart mobile devices (SMDs), multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and a base station (BS).

Prior to transporting bales to an outlet for utilization, producers often group or stack the bales at the edge of the field. This is a tedious and labor-intensive task. Also, bale retrieval is time-sensitive to avoid losing the dry matter or damaging crop regrowth. In this work we developed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for operational mapping and surveying of fields with bales waiting for removal. To that end, a commercial UAV (Inspire 2 with Zenmuse XS4 camera) was utilized to determine bale locations via the onboard vision system and the low-accuracy Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Also bale locations were estimated by ground survey utilizing an RTK-corrected GNSS signal, in order to determine the bale locating accuracy of the developed system. Seven fields were investigated, in which various number of bales had been produced (from 9 bales up to 58 bales) in corn stover and soybean stubble. Based on this work we were able to make the following observations. Field orthomosaic images generated with and without ground control points yielded localization accuracies that were practically similar. Hence, a localization error of less than 0.4 m was observed when aerial and ground surveys taking place in the same day. Results also showed that when flights occurred in the same day, the precision error was low (0.019-0.142 m for different fields). Different flight velocities and aircraft altitudes maintained an accuracy within practical limits of detecting bales while improving the field capacity up to 91% through the increase in flight velocity and 184% through doubling flight altitude.

The ground rescue operations are difficult to carry out because of the unavailability of transport infrastructure. However, drones, Unmanned Vehicles, can easily navigate to the areas where road networks have been destroyed or become ineffective. The fleet participating in the rescue operation should have drones with different capabilities in order to make the efforts more successful. A majority of existing systems in the literature offered a centralized system for these drones. However, the performance of the existing system starts decreasing as the required number of tasks increases. This research is based on the hypothesis that a distributed intelligent method is more effective than the centralized technique for relief operations performed by multiple drones. The research aims to propose a distributed method that allows a fleet of drones with diverse capabilities to communicate and collaborate, so that the task completion rate of rescue operations could be increased. The proposed solution consists of three main modules: 1) communication and message transmission module that enables collaboration between drones, 2) realignment module that allows drones to negotiate and occupy the best position in the air to optimize the coverage area, 3) situation monitoring module that identifies the ground situation and acts accordingly. To validate the proposed solution, we have performed a simulation using AirSim simulator and compared the results with the centralized system.

An extremely severe pollution episode with a maximum hourly O-3 mixing ratio of 160.4 ppb was observed. In addition to enhanced local photochemical production, both downward and advection transport in the lower troposphere may have played important roles in forming the pollution episode. The O-3-rich air masses in the lower free troposphere primarily originated from central China and the northern Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region.

As for the advection transport, large amounts of O-3 were transported outward from Shanghai in the planetary boundary layer under the influence of southeasterly winds during the field study. In this condition, the boundary-layer O-3 that was transported downward from the free troposphere in Shanghai could be transported back to the northern YRD region and accumulated therein, leading to the occurrence of severe O-3 pollution events over the whole YRD region.

We use field mapping and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based Structure from Motion (SfM) Photogrammetry to document otherwise inaccessible cliff-side exposures of seismic-to subseismic-scale vertical discordant breccias. LDBBs are up to 50 m in width, more than 80 m in height and display internal chaotic or aligned clast fabrics. The formation which generally contains the LDBBs is characterized by beds of cherty pelagic limestone intercalated with calcarenites, calciturbidites and horizons of mass transport deposits. The mass-transport deposits can be correlated across the chaotic breccia bodies, indicating only slight or no vertical displacement across the adjacent walls. The bases of the breccia bodies are always hidden below current sea level, while the rarely exposed tops are capped by bedded intervals of the host rock formation. Timing and origin of the studied breccias were determined using several lines of evidence, such as stratigraphic provenance of clasts in breccias, mutual relationships of structural and sedimentologic features, and previous studies which establish that the age of dolomitizing cements in the LDBBs formed at different times and by different processes (fault shearing and solution collapse). This work investigates the size, shape and geometry of these breccia bodies whilst also providing cm-scale detail of the textural features in otherwise inaccessible outcrops. We suggest that breccias formed as a result of solution exploiting a pre-existing fracture network characterized by large-scale vertical strike-slip or oblique-slip faults.

In this regard, we focus on an ultra-dense wireless network consisting of Femto Access Points (FAPs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), known as caching nodes, where there are more than one possible caching node to handle user's request. To efficiently cope with the dynamic topology of wireless networks and time-varying behavior of ground users, our focus is to develop an efficient connection scheduling framework, where ground users are autonomously trained to determine the optimal caching node, i.e., UAV or FAP. Our aim is to minimize users' access delay by maintaining a trade-off between the energy consumption of UAVs and the occurrence of handovers. To achieve these objectives, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem and propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Q-Network-based Connection Scheduling (CQN-CS) framework. More specifically, to solve the constructed multi-objective connection scheduling problem, a deep Q-Network model is developed as an efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to train ground users to handle their requests in an optimal and trustworthy fashion within the coupled UAV-based femtocaching network. The effectiveness of the proposed CQN-CS framework is evaluated in terms of the cache-hit ratio, user's access delay, energy consumption of UAVs, handover, lifetime of the network, and cumulative rewards.

We analysed videos to obtain the frequency of explosions, particle exit speeds and study eruption dynamics. Survival analysis of the repose time between explosions revealed that they are distributed according to log logistic distributions, in analogy with known sequences at other open vent volcanoes. We found differences among low intensity and high intensity explosions. Low intensity events are characterized by instantaneous pulses of magma associated with the burst of a gas slug. High intensity events are composed by multiple pulses, where volcanic particles can reach speeds of up to 150 m/s, separated by gas streaming and followed by a stationary phase, where particles are emitted at constant velocity, and a declining phase emitting a few small particles with speeds lower than 10 m/s.

Mass-rearing, and these post-factory SIT activities, have evolved into a well-established modular/industrial process that has adapted and adopted manufacturing principles such as the development of standard operational procedures (SOPs) and quality control (QC) standards, allowing a common understanding/agreement between producers and users of sterile insects at satellite ERFs. Shipment practices for short- and long-distance transport are well documented, and it is likely that they will continue to be developed and improved for current and new insect species according to their biological needs. Procedures for insect emergence, feeding, and holding for sexual maturation of sterile insects (including the designs of new holding containers) have gradually evolved because of a better understanding of their biological requirements. ERFs specialize in insect emergence, holding, providing food and water to the adults, maturation, and collection for release. For some target pests, such as moths, adults can be collected after emergence for direct transport and release, without previous holding and feeding of adults. Release of sterile insects varies depending on the species and the nature of the area-wide integrated pest management programme (AW-IPM). This chapter also reviews the methods of release - static, ground, and aerial (using aircraft with fixed-wing or rotary-wing, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)). Recently, developed technology has allowed prototyping of release equipment designed for UAVs. New release boxes and machines for a wide range of insect species have been developed, aiming to optimize equipment that enables variation in release densities, and takes into account other operational considerations according to the needs of action programmes. New ground- and aerial-release equipment has been tested and put into operation - increasing the quality of the released insects. Through the use of combined GPS/GIS, dedicated software, and devices plugged into computers and the internet, additional progress has been made in implementing electronic/navigating equipment that enables knowing the precise location of insect releases and recording the conditions of their aerial broadcast.

Easy access to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has opened up new opportunities for remote gas sampling and provides logistical and economic opportunities to improve GHG measurements. Methods This study presents synchronized gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) methods for the analysis of atmospheric gas samples (20-mL glass vessels) to determine the stable isotope ratios and concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O. To our knowledge there is no comprehensive GC/IRMS setup for successive measurement of CO2, CH4 and N2O analysis meshed with a UAV-based sampling system.

Results The precision of working gas standards achieved for delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of CO2 was 0.2 parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively. The mid-term precision for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of CH4 and N2O working gas standards was 0.4 parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively. Injection quantities of working gas standards indicated a relative standard deviation of 1%, 5% and 5% for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively. Measurements of atmospheric air samples demonstrated a standard deviation of 0.3 parts per thousand and 0.4 parts per thousand for the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values, respectively, of CO2, 0.5 parts per thousand for the delta C-13 value of CH4 and 0.3 parts per thousand for the delta N-15 value of N2O.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a control scheme that improves the fuel economy of a turbojet in its full operating envelope. Design/methodology/approach - A novel direct-thrust linear quadratic integral (LQI) approach, comprised by an optimal observer/controller satisfying specified performance parameters, is presented. The thrust estimator, based in a Wiener model, is validated with the experimental data of a micro-turbojet. Model uncertainty is characterized by analyzing variations between the identified model and measured data. The resulting uncertainty range is used to verify closed-loop stability with the circle criterion. The proposed controller provides stable responses with the specified performance in the whole operating range, even with after considering plant nonlinearities. Finally, the direct-thrust LQI is compared with a standard thrust controller to assess fuel economy and performance. Findings - The direct-thrust LQI approach reduced the fuel consumption by 2.1090% in the most realistic scenario. The controllers were also evaluated using the environmental effect parameter (EEP) and transient-thrust-specific fuel consumption (T-TSFC). These novel metrics are proposed to evaluate the environmental impact during transient-thrust operations. The direct-thrust LQI approach has a more efficient fuel consumption according to these metrics. The results also show that isolating the thrust dynamics within the feedback loop has an important impact in fuel economy. Controllers were also evaluated using the EEP and T-TSFC.

We evaluated sUAS pilot states during the tactical response to the 2018 Kilauea Volcano Lower East Rift Zone event, using a 3-minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) and wrist worn heart rate sensor. The field data, collected over four days, indicated that the sUAS pilots did not recover to baseline vigilance and physiological levels. Some pilots stopped participating over time, owing to logistical constraints of performing the 3-minute PVT test. Additionally, all pilots refrained from rating their perceived workload levels. We summarize the utility of and challenges associated with collecting performance, physiological, and subjective measures of pilot fatigue during real disaster response. Background: Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), which provide remote presence at disasters, are teleoperated by emergency responders who experience elevated fatigue levels exacerbated by disrupted sleep/rest schedule as a mission unfolds. Purpose: We assessed fatigue states of responders who flew sUAS in both day and night missions while assisting with tactical response during the 2018 Kilauea Volcano Lower East Rift Zone event.

Further, this study examines pharmacists' perceptions on drone delivery-pharmacists approved the use of drones to deliver EpiPen((R)) during emergencies but had concerns with drone safety and supply chain security. Laboratory simulated onboard drone conditions reflected typical missions. In these experiments, in vitro model and pharmaceutical equivalent formulations were subjected independently to 30 min vibrations at 5, 8.43, and 13.33 Hz, and temperature storage at 4, 25, 40, and 65 degrees C for 0, 0.5, 3, and 24 h. The chiral composition (an indicator of chemical purity that relates to molecular structure) and concentration of these adrenaline formulations were determined using ultraviolet (UV) and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). Adrenaline intrinsic stability was also explored by edge-of-failure experimentation to signpost the uppermost limits for safe transportation. During drone flight with EpiPen((R)), the temperature and vibration g-force were 10.7 degrees C and 1.8 g, respectively. No adverse impact on adrenaline was observed during drone flight and laboratory-simulated conditions shown by conformation to the British Pharmacopeia standards (p > 0.05 for CD and UV).

The urgency of OHCA treatment has led to the proposal of alternative avenues for better access to AEDs, particularly in rural settings. More recently, using unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) to deliver AEDs to rural OHCA sites has proven promising in improving survival rates. Objective: A pilot drone AED delivery program is currently being piloted in the community of Caledon, Ontario. The purpose of this study was to develop an understanding of public perception and acceptance of the use of drones for this purpose and to identify tailored community engagement strategies to ensure successful uptake. Methods: In-depth qualitative descriptive study using interviews and focus group data collection and inductive thematic analysis. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 67 community members (40 interviews; 2 focus groups of 15) at existing community events in the project area. Interview guides were used to ensure consistency across data collection events. Detailed field notes were recorded when audio-recording was not possible. Results: The central message seen throughout the data was quickly identified as the potential impact of low levels of CPR and AED literacy in the community over anything else including concerns about the drone. The impact of the community's existing relationship with the EMS; the need for bystander CPR & AED promotion prior to the program launch; and the value the community places on transparency and accountability related to the research and the drones were also key findings. In general, the drone concept was found to be acceptable but concerns about providing CPR and using the AED was what created anxieties in the lay public that we underestimated. Conclusion: Drone-delivered AEDs may be feasible and effective but successful uptake in smaller communities will require a deep understanding of a community's cardiac arrest literacy levels, information needs and readiness for innovation.

Battery-powered transportation is being adopted more frequently due to its potential to enable a more sustainable society by reducing vehicle emissions from fossil fuels. There has been exponential growth in the need for high-capacity LIBs in all types of EVs, including hybrid and full electric automobiles, e-bikes, and drones, as well as electric tools, cell phones, tablets, and, more recently, house storage; this growth significantly increases the consumption of source material commodities, especially cobalt. Despite its drop in price in the last couple of years due to increased mining, cobalt remains expensive, and its price increase has gained momentum again compared to other electrode materials due to higher demand. Moreover, its toxicity and difficult mining practices could result in many problems, including excessive carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emission along with a possible much higher demand in the long term. This provides a strong motivation to explore alternatives to battery source materials. In this article, we present a selection of our important works on LIBs, with a focus on alternative electrode chemistries by using abundant and sustainable material sources. As alternatives to traditional graphite-based anodes, we demonstrate the successful use of both silicon electrodes derived from beach sand and waste glass and carbon electrodes derived from portobello mushroom and waste plastic precursors. In addition, we demonstrate stable cycling of batteries with nonconventional electrode chemistries, such as lithium-sulfur with TiO2-coated sulfur electrodes and sulfur-silicon full cell batteries with integrated lithium sources. Batteries prepared by sustainable methods not only perform better than conventional ones but also result in reduced costs. Since accurate determination of battery state of health is another important challenge, we further present our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis of LIBs, which could potentially be utilized in safety evaluations of current and next-generation LIBs."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

However, with most of the sensitive data being transmitted over wireless links, security, privacy and trust management are emerging as big challenges to handle. IoT applications vary, from self-driving vehicles, drone deliveries, online shopping, IoT smart cities, e-healthcare and robotic assisted surgery, with many applications focused on Voice over IP (VoIP) and require securing data from potential eavesdroppers and attackers. One well-known technique is a hidden exchange of secret data between the devices for which security can be achieved with audio steganography. Audio steganography is an efficient, reliable and low-latency mechanism used for securely communicating sensitive data over wireless links. MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3's (MP3's) bit rate falls within the acceptable sound quality required for audio. Its low level of noise distortion does not affect its sound quality, which makes it a good carrier medium for steganography and watermarking. The strength of any embedding technique lies with its undetectability measure. Although there are many detection techniques available for both steganography and watermarking, the detection accuracy of secret data has been proven erroneous. It has yet to be confirmed whether different bit rates or a constant sampling rate for embedding eases detection. The accuracy of detecting hidden information in MP3 files drops with the influence of the compression rate or increases. This drop or increase is caused by either the increase in file track size, the sampling rate or the bit rate. This paper presents an experimental study that evaluates the detection accuracy of the secret data embedded in MP3. Training data were used for the embedding and detection of text messages in MP3 files. Several iterations were evaluated. The experimental results show that the used approach was effective in detecting the embedded data in MP3 files. An accuracy rate of 97.92% was recorded when detecting secret data in MP3 files under 128-kbps compression.

The simulation results of implementing an LQR controller on the nonlinear model for tracking problem shows that the system has convincing performance, and while control inputs are constrained, controlling the system is possible with no significant restrictions.

Since previous work has focused on classical and metaheuristic-based approaches, none of these approaches have a self-adaptive approach. In this paper, the challenges and weaknesses of previous methods are examined in the form of a table. Furthermore, we propose an agent-based self-protective method (ASP-UAVN) for UAVNs that is based on the Human Immune System (HIS). In ASP-UAS, the safest route from the source UAV to the destination UAV is chosen according to a self-protective system. In this method, a multi-agent system using an Artificial Immune System (AIS) is employed to detect the attacking UAV and choose the safest route. In the proposed ASP-UAVN, the route request packet (RREQ) is initially transmitted from the source UAV to the destination UAV to detect the existing routes. Then, once the route reply packet (RREP) is received, a self-protective method using agents and the knowledge base is employed to choose the safest route and detect the attacking UAVs. The proposed ASP-UAVN has been validated and evaluated in two ways: simulation and theoretical analysis. The results of simulation evaluation and theory analysis showed that the ASP-UAS increases the Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) by more than 17.4, 20.8, and 25.91%, and detection rate by more than 17.2, 23.1, and 29.3%, and decreases the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) by more than 14.4, 16.8, and 20.21%, the false-positive and false-negative rate by more than 16.5, 25.3, and 31.21% those of SUAS-HIS, SFA and BRUIDS methods, respectively.

Methods We retrospectively analysed the data of the patients who underwent flexible ureterorenoscopy (FURS) for renal stones larger than 20 mm between 2010 and 2019. The investigated parameters were OT, UAS using, and infection status. The data were analysed by forming two groups according to whether the OT was less than 60 minutes and more, whether the UAS was used and whether an infection occurred. In addition, independent risk factors that may affect postoperative urinary infection development were also investigated by logistic regression analysis. And, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to determine a cut-off value in OT terms, where infection rates increase more. Results A total of 575 patients were enrolled in the study. The rates of the usage of UAS and infection were greater statistically in the group for longer than 60 minutes.

As the decisions interact with each other and the UAV energy is limited, the formulated JCTO problem is intractable directly and timely. To this end, we propose a deep supervised learning scheme to enable intelligent edge for real-time decision-making in the highly dynamic vehicular networks. In specific, we first propose a clustering-based two-layered (CBTL) algorithm to solve the JCTO problem offline. With a given content placement strategy, we devise a time-based graph decomposition method to jointly optimize the content delivery and trajectory design, with which we then leverage the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to further optimize the content placement.

The network density and content request distribution with spatio-temporal dimensions are labeled as channeled images and input to the CNN-based model, and the results achieved by the CBTL algorithm are labeled as model outputs. With the CNN-based model, a function which maps the input network information to the output decision can be intelligently learnt to make timely inference and facilitate online decisions.

Specifically, for the joint hidden support vector, we consider a more realistic 3D support vector in both azimuth and elevation direction. Moreover, the spatial sparsity structure and the time-varying probabilistic relationship between degree patterns named the spatial and temporal correlation, respectively, are studied for each direction. Furthermore, we derive a novel 3D dynamic turbo approximate message passing (3D-DTAMP) algorithm to recursively track the dynamic channel with the 3D-2D-MM priors.

For each given strategy of UAV routing and loading, the optimal aborting strategy needs to take into consideration both the expected cost due to UAV destruction and the expected cost due to unfinished tasks. Eventually, the optimal UAV routing and loading strategy can be solved assuming that the optimal aborting strategy is always adopted, with the objective to minimize the total cost of UAVs destruction, total cost of damaged cargoes, and the expected cost of unvisited targets.

There is however not any legacy soil data available for this region. Based on soil knowledge and previous evidences, it is known that various topographic attributes have considerable effects on soil development in such areas. To reach this goal, random forest (RF) models were used to relate a large set of environmental covariates and a total of 64 soil profiles in a part of the Iranian loess plateau. The prediction of a soil map at four soil taxonomic levels was first carried out in an area of about 5390 ha. Geomorphology, elevation and aspect were the most important covariates that impact on the predictive performances of the soil map at each taxonomic level. The accuracy of the RF models was tested by 10-fold cross-validation and reported using the overall accuracy and Kappa index, which were equal to 76% and 0.56 at suborder level, 72% and 0.51 at great group level, 54% and 0.31 at subgroup level, and 40% and 0.23 at family level, respectively. Conversely, the results of uncertainty, as reported by the confusion index (CI), indicated that the uncertainty tends to increase towards lower taxonomic categories (i.e., from suborder to family level). Having relied on the covariates importance, the impact of pixel size and accuracy of topographic attributes were assessed with the aim of improving the prediction at a comparison area of 210 ha. Two Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were considered. The first one was derived from topographic lines initially drawn at 1:25,000 scale and a spatial resolution of 5 m (DEM A), while the second one was obtained at a 0.3 m spatial resolution (DEM B) using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). At the suborder level, the overall accuracy was 95% and 78% for the predicted maps with 0.3 x 0.3 m and 5 x 5 m pixel sizes, respectively. It is thus shown that the extracted DEM from a UAV technique can lead to an improved accuracy for the spatial prediction of soil maps at different taxonomic levels.

Phenological processes have been studied from landscape to global scales using Earth observing satellite data, and at local scale by in situ surveys of individual plants. Now, data acquired from multi-spectral sensors on drone platforms provide flexible opportunities for monitoring phenology from individual plants to small ecosystem scales efficiently, allowing community and species level information to be derived. We captured a time-series of drone-acquired normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with a multi-spectral sensor (Parrot Sequoia, (Parrot, France)) over a highly heterogeneous ecosystem in Cornwall, UK, during a period of spring green-up. We monitored NDVI trajectories at the individual crown and species' level. For deciduous crowns, we derived metrics representative of spring phenological stages: Start-of-spring (SOS), middle-of-spring green-up (MOG) and start-of-peak greenness (SOP) using a logistic function. While the exact timing of SOS, MOG and SOP appeared susceptible to understorey effects and saturation of the NDVI, relative timing of green-up for a subset of species was plausible in relation to phenological observations from an extended geographic region and in situ plant area index (PAI) measurements. In evergreen vegetation (Pinus spp.) subtle changes were also detected through the growing season. The impact of illumination differences was analysed for image pairs during leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. While significant, these effects were small (mean absolute NDVI deviation of up to 0.034 for leaf-off, 0.013 for leaf-on conditions), meaning that data captured under both constant direct and diffuse irradiance conditions can be used together and that cloudy conditions should not lead to data gaps.

We analyzed on-site data (2018-2019) concerning small-scale (hillslope and micro basin) processes: inter-rill gross erosion, vegetation coverage factor, sediment yield, and sediment delivery ratio. We measured gross erosion in four hillslopes using metal pins; rainfall erosivity using an automatic meteorological station; soil erodibility; and siltation of five check-dams that control micro basins (10(1)-10(3) m(2)) by means of an unmanned aerial vehicle. Gross erosion (10(2) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1); 7.5 mm yr(-1)) is up to 100-fold the regional mean value and up to 45-times the tolerable soil-loss reference value (0.17 mm yr(-1)), showing that degradation still evolves. Sparse small vegetation directly exposes two thirds of the soil, with a high vegetation factor (0.90). The sediment delivery ratio of the micro basins is 0.88, compatible with low (12%) sediment-deposition pattern at this scale. The Maner delivery-ratio model mimicked field observation, which indicates that relief is the key element influencing sediment deposition there. The check-dam effectiveness considerably decreased after the first decade of operation due to high siltation rates.

One of these terraces, the T3 surface, is dated to 7.0(+1.9)/(-1.6) kyr using Be-10 cosmogenic depth profile analysis. Well-preserved, dated terraces make this an ideal site to test the utility of morphological modelling in constraining ages of the young terrace risers. To do this, 35 topographic swath profiles across the terrace risers are extracted from a 0.2 m-resolution digital elevation model produced using structure from motion from photos collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle.

This nonlinear model produces ages of 7.3 +/- 0.5 kyr for T3/T4 and 4.0 +/- 0.2 kyr for T2/T3; these ages are consistent with terrace surface ages deduced by using vertical offset divided by independently determining average throw rate. This comparison shows the advantage of a nonlinear model in defining ages of young scarps. Furthermore, we explored the minor effect of heterogeneous degradation along steep sections of the scarp profiles. The nonlinear scarp modelling scheme we develop in this paper is suitable for studying scarp degradation in other regions.

Routing in VANETs is difficult as compared to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs); topological constraints such as high mobility, node density, and frequent path failure make the VANET routing more challenging. To scale complex routing problems, where static and dynamic routings do not work well, AI-based clustering techniques are introduced. Evolutionary algorithm-based clustering techniques are used to solve such routing problems; moth flame optimization is one of them. In this work, an intelligent moth flame optimization-based clustering (IMOC) for a drone-assisted vehicular network is proposed. This technique is used to provide maximum coverage for the vehicular node with minimum cluster heads (CHs) required for routing. Delivering optimal route by providing end-to-end connectivity with minimum overhead is the core issue addressed in this article. Node density, grid size, and transmission ranges are the performance metrics used for comparative analysis. These parameters were varied during simulations for each algorithm, and the results were recorded. A comparison was done with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms for routing such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO), and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO). Experimental outcomes for IMOC consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques for each scenario. A framework is also proposed with the support of a commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to improve routing by minimizing path creation overhead in VANETs.

The key resource to detect the Land Usages is aerial Images. The advancement in technology in form of satellites, drones, unmanned aerial vehicles do capture the tons of wide land cover images. Aerial images are used for various purposes alias getting an overview to put up the settlement by making construction, extracting mineral deposits, disaster mitigation planning, disaster recovery, and surveillance. Automated land usage identification with help of modern machine learning algorithms may be a great boon to mankind. Different feature extraction methods are being explored to represent aerial image content in the signature form, these features are mainly taken as a global or local content description of the image. Feature Level Fusion of both the global and the local content description features may give a more accurate capability for identification of land usage. The paper proposes feature level fusion of global features extracted using Thepade's Sorted Block Truncation Coding (Thepade SBTC) and local features extracted using Sauvola Thresholding for land usage identification. Consideration of more than one Machine Learning classifiers as an ensemble has proven better than individual Machine Learning classifiers. Thepade SBTC is explored in aerial image feature extraction with nine variations as TSBTC 2-ary, TSBTC 3-ary, TSBTC 4-ary, TSBTC 5-ary, TSBTC 6-ary, TSBTC 7-ary, TSBTC 8-ary, TSBTC 9-ary, and TSBTC 10-ary. The experimentation is done on UC Land Merced Dataset having 2100 images spread across 21 land usage types.

Principal results: After optimizing placenta vascular clearing and perfusion protocols, we performed contrast enhanced MR angiography and MR relaxometry on eight carefully selected placentas while they were perfused via the umbilical arteries (UAs). Additionally, two of these placentas underwent maternal perfusion via the intervillous space (IVS). Despite striving for homogenous perfusion across the whole placenta, imaging results were highly heterogeneous for both UA and IVS perfused placentas. By histology, we observed blood congestion in the villi in regions that showed low UA perfusion during MRI. In two placentas prominent chorionic arteries followed by adjacent veins underwent contrast enhancement in the absence of villous capillary blush. The single placenta from a pregnancy affected by IUGR had the most homogeneous villous capillary perfusion. Major conclusions: A dual perfusion system for ex vivo placentas compatible with MRI permitted assessment of UA and IVS placental perfusion. We observed spatial UA perfusion heterogeneity and evidence for arteriovenous shunting in placentas from normal pregnancies and deliveries, but relative villous capillary perfusion homogeneity in a single IUGR placenta.

In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight; flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to rendezvous with the truck."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999885559082031}], "status": "success"}

Dunes evolve due to variations in the supply and removal of sediment via both wind and waves, and on stabilization through vegetation colonization and growth. One aspect of dune evolution that is poorly understood is the longshore variation in dune response to morphodynamic forcing, which can occur over small spatial scales. In this paper, a fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is used to measure the longshore variation in evolution of a dune system in a megatidal environment. Dune sections to the east and west of the study site are prograding whereas the central portion is static or eroding. The measured variation in dune response is compared to mesoscale intertidal bar migration and short-term measurements of longshore variation in wave characteristics during two storms. Intertidal sand bar migration is measured using satellite imagery: crescentic intertidal bars are present in front of the accreting portion of the beach to the west and migrate onshore at a rate of 0.1-0.2 m/day; episodically the eastern end of the bar detaches from the main bar and migrates eastward to attach near the eastern end of the study area; bypassing the central eroding section. Statistically significant longshore variation in intertidal wave heights were measured using beachface mounted pressure transducers: the largest significant wave heights are found in front of the dune section suffering erosion. Spectral differences were noted with more narrow-banded spectra in this area but differences are not statistically significant. These observations demonstrate the importance of three-dimensionality in intertidal beach morphology on longshore variation in dune evolution; both through longshore variation in onshore sediment supply and through causing longshore variation in near-dune significant wave heights."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999961853027344}], "status": "success"}

This method is based on the use of the Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) deep learning algorithm, which allows the instance segmentation of objects after an initial training on manually labeled data. The algorithm is capable of identifying and classifying objects present in an image at the pixel scale, without human intervention, in a matter of seconds. This work demonstrates that it is possible to train the model to detect non-overlapping coarse sediments on scaled images, in order to extract their individual size and morphological characteristics with high efficiency (R-2 = 0.98; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 3.9 mm). It is then possible to measure element size profiles over a sedimentary body, as it was done on the pebble beach of Etretat (Normandy, France) in order to monitor the granulometric spatial variability before and after a storm. Applied at a larger scale using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) derived ortho-images, the method allows the accurate characterization and high-resolution mapping of the surface coarse sediment size, as it was performed on the two pebble beaches of Etretat (D50 = 5.99 cm) and Hautot-sur-Mer (D50 = 7.44 cm) (Normandy, France). Validation results show a very satisfying overall representativity (R-2 = 0.45 and 0.75; RMSE = 6.8 mm and 9.3 mm at Etretat and Hautot-sur-Mer, respectively), while the method remains fast, easy to apply and low-cost, although the method remains limited by the image resolution (objects need to be longer than 4 cm), and could still be improved in several ways, for instance by adding more manually labeled data to the training dataset, and by considering more accurate methods than the ellipse fitting for measuring the particle sizes."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999964237213135}], "status": "success"}

Envisioned oil-free vehicle transportation systems implementing gas bearings range from small size gas turbines, to unmanned aerial vehicles, to turbochargers (TC), and more to come. In these vehicles, base or support transient displacements transmit forces exciting the rotor-bearing system; hence, the need to characterize system integrity under stringent operating conditions. This paper reports experiments demonstrating the ability of a hybrid gas bearing-rotor system to withstand maneuver actions that suddenly remove the ground support. The test rig consists of a rigid motor-rotor, supported on tilting pad hybrid gas bearings supplied with pressurized air. The rotor is housed in a thick steel casing that is attached to a rigid base plate. The whole test rig hangs from a crane; two steel cables connect to one side of the base and a nylon webbing attaches to the other side of the base. The other end of the webbing ties to a release mechanism, which when released, frees one side of the rig base. Suddenly, the whole test rig rotates and displaces downward while the tensions in the taut cables rapidly increase and pull the test rig as it swings back and forth. The crane support enables two release maneuvers: one turns the rig similar to 90 deg and the other flips it 180 deg, both events occurring while the rotor spins at 70 krpm (surface speed 105m/s). The measured rotor displacements relative to the casing demonstrate a momentary increase in motion amplitude, up to similar to 1.15mm since the bearings also displace, along with a maximum casing deceleration of similar to 7g when the cables stop the rig fall. The measurements show the rotor response is free of subsynchronous whirl frequencies that could evidence a rotor dynamic instability. Very low frequency motions denote the swing frequency of the hanging rig and jerk motions from the crane lifting and bouncing when the rig is at its lowest vertical position. In one instance, power to the motor unexpectedly interrupted and the rotor underwent an unplanned shaft speed coastdown. In spite of the large displacements recorded, the rotor survived both events; it continues to operate to this day. The experiments demonstrate that the hybrid gas bearing system could withstand large amplitude rotor excursions. The measurements provide a novel method for testing gas bearings, as the induced excitations are multidirectional, while the test rig encounters a short period of free falling, followed by a quick deceleration with large forces. A simple kinetics model of the test rig drop produces peak decelerations similar in magnitude to those measured."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The results shown a decrease of the drag force, and an increase of the lift and forward pitch moment due to the presence of the ground. These effects are magnified by the translational velocity, which also deviates the flow generated by the propellers and delays the interaction with the obstacle. Both in the approaching and leaving to the obstacle, increases of up to 60% in the pitch moment are observed.

We draw on field observations from ground referencing campaigns, alongside remote sensing technology, including satellite images and unmaimed aerial vehicle campaigns. Four low wooded island sites are compared: two in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia (Nymph Island and Two Isles) and two in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia (Sabangko and Tanakeke Island). The Spermonde and GBR sites can be distinguished in relation to the process regimes that entrain, distribute and deposit sediments on the reef surface thereby providing a substrate for further mangrove colonisation, particularly the presence or absence of cyclones as a key determinant of sediment transport. The influence of human populations inhabiting these sites is also an important control on their geomorphology. In the Spermonde Archipelago, local communities have altered sand cays through the development of infrastructure and converted mangroves to shrimp farms, while sand cays and mangroves have remained largely unaltered by humans on the GBR.

Importantly, effective coordination and collaboration are facilitated by big data and modern information processing (BDMIP) systems that are complex and interlocked with contemporary information and communication technology (ICT). This study simplifies BDMIP systems by using a comprehensive methodology (literature review and a multi-criteria decision-making approach, called the analytic network process) and explores its key determinants and other interconnected factors. The data were collected from humanitarian managers, working in horizontally (e.g. governments, local and international humanitarian organisations) and vertically (e.g. supply chain partners) collaborated organisations. Three systems (manual, semi-automated, and fully automated) are investigated, which depend on various determinants for operational excellence interlinked with modern big data technology and its components. The results indicate that dynamic compatibility is the most important determinant for such systems to support operational excellence, followed by real-time response, cost, end-to-end visibility, and operational service quality. The implementation of fully automated systems is less cost-effective. This attributes to contemporary dimensions and enablers (e.g. the internet of things, big data collection and analytics, effective data and information sharing, modern unmanned aerial vehicles (called drones), skills for mining structured and unstructured data, among others). Semi-automated systems are also imperative for certain enablers (e.g. data accuracy, data reliability, and personalised data exchange).

The aim of this study was to investigate how many patients ended up with a ureteral stricture after URS at our hospital and how these were treated. We also wanted to identify potential risk factors for postendoscopic stricture formation. Materials and Methods:A retrospective evaluation of 1001 URSs for stone treatment at the day-case surgery unit between 2013 and 2018 was performed. Data on pretreatment status, the surgical procedure, and follow-up were recorded. Exact chi(2)and independent samplest-tests were used comparing data among those who developed strictures and those who did not.

An EMS is generally able to respond to 90% of higher priority calls in less than 9 minutes, with the best chance of survival being with a response time of 4-5 minutes. The major obstacle here is that a shorter response time would require the needed resources not to pass a certain threshold in a cost/benefit analysis. This paper aims to investigate the use of drones in as an EMS to improve response times. Although the literature already provides many examples of drones used for this purpose, they have all been developed as a prototype. This confirms the technical feasibility of a drone-based solution, but there is no evidence of the economic viability for such a service. The answer to this comes by analyzing the performance of an integrated-with-drones service as a whole. For this reason, we have redesigned the entire EMS model by including drones, and we have addressed the main issues, such as which types of service can be provided from drones, in which case, what the technical requirements for drones would be, and so on. Furthermore, we developed a specific procedure to keep the number of drones at a minimum level under the constraint of the minimum intervention time. The proposed model has been applied to a real EMS case for a city in the south of Italy. The outcome was that 96 drones were able to cover an area of 2,800 km(2), providing an intervention time of 4.5 minutes on average at an annual cost of less than (sic)300,000.

The area of study is located in the NW part of the Krafla Fissure Swarm (NE Iceland), a volcanotectonic rift composed of eruptive centres, extension fractures, and normal faults. The surveyed sector is characterized by the presence of a hyaloclastite ridge composed of deposits dated, on a stratigraphic basis, to the Weichselian High Glacial (29.1-12.1 ka BP), and a series of lava flows mostly dating back to 11-12 ka BP. The integration of remotely sensed surveys and field inspections enabled us to recognize that this segment of the Krafla rift is made of grabens arranged en-echelon with a left-stepping geometry. A major graben increases in width in correspondence of the hyaloclastite cone; we interpret this geometry as resulting from the mechanical contrast between the stiffer lava succession and the softer hyaloclastites, which favours the development of concentric faults. We also measured a total extension of 16.6 m and 11.2 m along the fractures affecting the lava units, and a total extension in the hyaloclastites of 29.3 m.

Our aim is to produce optimal assignments such that the average waiting time at destinations is minimized. Since noisy travel time estimates result in suboptimal assignments, we propose a method that offers robustness to uncertainty by making use of redundant robot assignments. However, solving the redundant assignment problem optimally is strongly NP-hard. Hence, we exploit the structural properties of our mathematical problem formulation to propose a polynomial-time, near-optimal solution. We demonstrate that our problem can be reduced to minimizing a supermodular cost function subject to a matroid constraint. This allows us to develop a greedy assignment algorithm, for which we derive suboptimality bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with simulations on transport networks with correlated uncertain edge costs and uncertain node positions that lead to noisy travel time estimates. Comparisons to benchmark algorithms show that our method performs near-optimally and significantly better than the nonredundant assignment. Finally, our findings include results on the benefit of diversity and complementarity in redundant robot coalitions; these insights contribute toward providing resilience to uncertainty through the targeted composition of robot coalitions. Note to Practitioners-This article is motivated by the problem of assigning mobile robots (e.g., vehicles and drones) to goals when travel times from robot origins to goal locations are uncertain. Existing robust assignment methods deal with uncertainty by minimizing risk or by predefining acceptable risk thresholds. In this article, we propose a complementary method that offers robustness to uncertainty by making use of robot redundancy. In other words, we assign more robots than necessary to a given goal, in the expectation that one of the redundant robots will reach the goal faster (than the originally assigned robot). However, solving this redundant assignment problem is computationally intractable for large systems. By characterizing the mathematical problem, we show how the redundant assignment problem can be solved efficiently. We apply our assignment algorithm to transport network problems to reduce the average waiting times at goal locations when travel times from vehicle origins to destinations are uncertain and potentially also correlated. Our results show that exploiting robot redundancy is an effective approach to reducing waiting times. In this work, we build on the premise that time is the primary commodity, and we do not explicitly model the additional cost of utilizing redundant robots. Future work should more explicitly address the tradeoff between the cost of providing redundancy (e.g., travel costs and robot costs) and performance gains."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

For beyond line of sight operations, given the availability of cellular technologies, the UAV community has explored the possibility of using the cellular network instead, which could bring benefits such as an additional channel for control and telemetry, extension of range, and allowing the UAV to interact with cloud services while it flies, via a data connection.

The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Synchronised Mobile Battery Swapping (EVRPTW-SMBS) is introduced in which route planning is carried out in two interdependent levels: (i) for the ECVs to deliver customers' demands, and (ii) for the Battery Swapping Vans (BSVs) to swap the depleted battery on an ECV with a fully charged one at a designated time and space. Each BSV route can provide the battery swapping service to multiple ECVs, and each ECV can extend its autonomy by requesting the battery swapping service for as many times as required with no need to divert from its original delivery route. The EVRPTW-SMBS opens up multiple opportunities to facilitate eco-friendly goods distribution using ECVs and brings in extra flexibility and cost savings. At the same time, it is a challenging problem to tackle mainly due to the interdependence problem that stems from the spatio-temporal synchronisation requirement between the vehicles in the two levels (i.e. ECVs and BSVs). To tackle these complications, the paper proposes a methodology for exact evaluation of an EVRPTW-SMBS solution based on a two-stage hybridisation of a dynamic programming and an integer programming algorithm, and places the resulting procedure at the heart of an intensified large neighbourhood search algorithm to solve instances of the EVRPTW-SMBS efficiently. A library of EVRPTW-SMBS test instances is developed and used to demonstrate the added value of the proposed problem variant and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Our results demonstrate the benefits of using BSVs in the design of the delivery routes for ECVs, and indicate that a particular variant of the proposed algorithms which is based on a specific lexicographical decomposition routine can efficiently approximate the optimal solution to the EVRPTW-SMBS.

To this end, we propose a hybrid relative passive RFID localization method (ReLoc) based on both the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and measured phases, which orders the RFID tags horizontally and vertically. In this article, the phase-based variant maximum likelihood estimation is proposed for lateral positioning, and the RSSI profiles of two tilted antennas are compared with each other for level distinguishing. We implement the proposed positioning system ReLoc with commercial off-the-shelf RFID devices. The experiment in a warehouse shows that ReLoc is a powerful solution for practical item-level inventory management. The experimental results show that ReLoc achieves an average lateral and level ordering accuracy of 94.6% and 94.3%, respectively. Notably, when considering liquid or metal materials inside the carton or tag distortion, ReLoc still performs excellently with more than 93% ordering accuracy both horizontally and vertically, indicating the robustness of the proposed method."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999948740005493}], "status": "success"}

Many of these deaths might be prevented if overdose-reversal medications such as naloxone are administered in a timely manner. Drones may help overcome barriers to timely arrival on scene for opioid overdoses. This study analyses the time required for a drone carrying naloxone to traverse various distances, simulating the response time for a drone to the scene of an opioid overdose. For comparison, we used the time required for ambulances to traverse similar distances while responding to the scene of actual or suspected opioid overdoses. Methods Fifty flight trials, using a modified Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) 'Inspire 2' drone, were conducted across seven distances, and the travel time for the drone was then compared with historical response time data from 200 actual or suspected opioid overdose cases that occurred within Detroit, Michigan. Results We determined with 95% certainty that drone arrival times were discernibly quicker than ambulance arrival times at all distances where sufficient data were available to perform statistical comparisons including 0.5 km, 1.0 km, 1.5 km, 2.0 km and 3.0 km. Conclusion We have shown that a drone is capable of travelling several ranges of straight-line (ie, 'as the crow flies') distance faster than an ambulance. Further exploration into the use of drones to deliver life-saving therapies in urban and rural settings is warranted. Head-to-head prospective trials that consider the practical challenges of medical drone delivery are needed to better understand the viability of incorporating this technology into existing emergency response infrastructure."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999816417694092}], "status": "success"}

The proposed system is built upon on the classical teach-and-repeat framework, which is widely adopted in infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue. For these applications, a human's intention is essential for deciding the topological structure of the flight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching trajectories and changing environments prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system from being applied flexibly and robustly. In this article, instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically equivalent one. The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles during flights, a fast local perception method and a sliding-windowed replanning method are integrated into our system, to generate safe and dynamically feasible local trajectories onboard. We name our system as teach-repeat-replan. It can capture users' intention of a flight mission, convert an arbitrarily jerky teaching path to a smooth repeating trajectory, and generate safe local replans to avoid unexpected collisions. The proposed planning system is integrated into a complete autonomous quadrotor with global and local perception and localization submodules. Our system is validated by performing aggressive flights in challenging indoor/outdoor environments.

However, under complex field conditions, such as diverse fertilization methods, different crop growth stages, and various sowing periods, the accuracy of lodging identification must be improved. Therefore, a maize plot featuring different growth stages was selected in this study to explore an applicable and accurate lodging extraction method. Based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), we propose an effective and rapid feature screening method (AIC method) and compare its performance using indexed methods (i.e., variation coefficient and relative difference). Seven feature sets extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images of lodging and nonlodging maize were established using a canopy height model (CHM) and the multispectral imagery acquired from the UAV. In addition to accuracy parameters (i.e., Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy), the difference index (DI) was applied to search for the optimal window size of texture features. After screening all feature sets by applying the AIC method, binary logistic regression classification (BLRC), maximum likelihood classification (MLC), and random forest classification (RFC) were utilized to discriminate among lodging and nonlodging maize based on the selected features. The results revealed that the optimal window sizes of the gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and the gray-level difference histogram statistical (GLDM) texture information were 17 x 17 and 21 x 21, respectively. The AIC method incorporating GLCM texture yielded satisfactory results, obtaining an average accuracy of 82.84% and an average Kappa value of 0.66 and outperforming the index screening method (59.64%, 0.19). Furthermore, the canopy structure feature (CSF) was more beneficial than other features for identifying maize lodging areas at the plot scale.

After rewriting the time-delay dynamics as a transport PDE of which the left boundary connects with the sandwiched system, a state observer is built to estimate the states of the overall system of ODE-heterodirectional coupled hyperbolic PDEs-ODE-transport PDE using the right boundary state of the last transport PDE.

The objectives of this study were to compare the drift potential of three different volume median diameter (VMD, or Dv0.5) of 100,150 and 200 mu m from a commercial quadcopter equipped with centrifugal nozzles exposed to different wind speeds under field conditions. Prior to field test, the droplet size of the centrifugal nozzle was mea-sured by a laser-diffraction particle-size analyzer. The results showed that the relationship between rotation speed and Dv0.5 agrees with the negative power function. Field tests found that the deposition at 12 m downwind direction decreased by an order of magnitude compared with the average deposition within the in-swath zone. The deposition of almost all the treatments at 50 m downwind is lower than the detection limits of 0.0002 mu L/cm(2).

Understanding these processes requires new conceptual frameworks, interdisciplinarity, and a strong technology-assisted approach. We propose a focus on the Critical Zone as a useful conceptual framework in studies of Anthropocene geomorphology. Prior studies have assessed the Anthropocene with a focus on soils, which are generally considered the unifying thread of the Critical Zone. The Critical Zone in its entirety, however, extends from the top of the canopy to the base of the groundwater system. This concept thus permits a systems approach to geomorphology across scales, addressing the extensive role of human impact on Earth surface processes. Changing climatic conditions impact the delivery of water to the Critical Zone, causing an expansion of arid lands. Land-cover alteration is decreasing infiltration, armoring surfaces, increasing surface runoff, enhancing erosion rates, and is expected to expand in the future. Thus, the benefit of using the Critical Zone as a lens to study geomorphology will result in a broad, unified interdisciplinary study of the Anthropocene. These studies can be aided by modern technology, including drones and machine-learning applications. The trend toward technology-driven studies will continue throughout the geosciences, and geomorphology will be well-aided by its use.

The irrigation doses were 50, 70, 85, and 100 % of the actual evapotranspiration (ETc). The experiment was performed in the Peruvian Arid Coastal Region (13.10 S, 76.37 W). On-ground destructive plant measurements (7 times) allowed to obtain the leaf area index (LAI) and the canopy equivalent water thickness (EWTcanopy) to validate the experiment. Similarly, volumetric soil moisture was monitored at three hours interval using time-domain reflectometry. High-resolution multispectral imagery was acquired along the growing season (10 times) using an unmanned aerial vehicle. NDVI at plant level was obtained based on oversegmented imagery. The canopy NDVI growth curves were obtained in relation to the irrigation treatments and growing degree days (GDD) using a nonlinear mixed model. Deficit irrigation doses (50, 70 and 85 % ETc) induced lower biomass accumulation and greatly affected LAI and EWTcanopy, attaining lower values (p < 0.05) than the control (100 % ETc). In spite of reaching higher LAI and EWTcanopy values, 70 % ETc was not significantly different from 50 % ETc (p < 0.05) showing the difficulty to accurately discriminate treatments with high deficit irrigation; 85 % ETc produced important differences on EWTcanopy and LAI compared to the other deficit irrigation treatments (p < 0.05) due to a higher leaf area expansion. Deficit irrigation doses led to less vigorous plants resulting in lower NDVI compared to the control. Notwithstanding 50 % ETc obtained lower NDVI values than 70 % ETc, differences were not significant. Volumetric soil moisture was consistent with the irrigation treatments, resulting in a decreased trend with decreasing water application along the growing season. A three-parameter logistic mixed model was found to be well-suited to fit the tomato canopy NDVI growth curves in function of the irrigation treatments (i.e. fixed effects) considering the plant-specific variability (i.e. random effects). At maturity stage, significant differences of the deficit irrigation treatments from the control were obtained (p < 0.05) when cumulative effect of the treatments was well-defined and NDVI reached asymptotic behavior. During the vegetative stage, the inflection point marked the fastest NDVI growth rate for the 100 % ETc treatment whereas the lowest for the 50 % ETc (p < 0.05). The diagnosis plots and the low root mean squared error of the residuals indicated the suitability of using the three-parameter logistic growth curve estimated as a nonlinear mixed model to predict NDVI."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

One model assumes no clustering of the wind turbines, and the other model uses a greedy approach for determining the ground vehicle route.

Simulation and triage need to be as effective as possible to train professionals for true emergencies involving mass casualty. Although MCI simulation and triage have been used in the pre-professional setting (i.e. medical school, nursing school, etc.), more data is required regarding quality improvement of these simulations. This study focuses on quality improvement of MCI simulation and triage in the pre-professional training. In order to evaluate simulation quality to optimize future triage simulations, this study had three specific aims: (1) assess participant accuracy of triage after training in Sort, Assess, Life-Saving Interventions, Triage/Transport (SALT); (2) evaluate the role of stress and confidence in participants of triage simulation; (3) determine trainees' perception of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in the setting of mass casualty simulation. Methods A total of 44 attendees of the University of Central Florida (UCF) College of Medicine Global Health Conference participated in this study across three groups. Each group was provided a 15-minute lecture on SALT protocol. After the training, the participants continued to a 30minute simulation in which they were asked to accurately triage up to 46 patient-actors. Each participants' triage designations were compared to the previously assigned designations of each patient-actor. Pre-and post-simulation surveys were collected and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL). All other data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Qualitative and Likert data for the simulation were collected from 44 participants. Given a total of 1,113 triage scores (average of 25.29 triage designations per person), there was data to support that novice learners in this study tended to under-triage using the SALT protocol after 15-minute SALT training, with an overall accuracy of 52.43%. Survey data showed that confidence in mass casualty triage improved post-simulation, improving from median 3/10 to 5/10. Most participants were unaware of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in MCI but most had positive opinions of their usefulness in MCI after the simulation, with a median score of 8/10. Conclusions Participant accuracy of triage after undergoing a 15-minute training in SALT triage was 52.43%, with a non-statistically significant tendency to under-triage. This accuracy level is consistent with other studies of SALT triage in MCI, but the tendency to undertriage requires further study for validation. Stress levels during the simulation were significantly elevated, while postsimulation confidence increased significantly from pre-simulation. The perception of drone utility in MCI was favorable among participants in this study, indicating drones may be useful for first response teams in future mass casualty simulations."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

This paper surveys established and novel last-mile concepts and puts special emphasis on the decision problems to be solved when setting up and operating each concept.

The pluri-disciplinary role of UAVs is outlined in numerous studies associated with mass earth movements, volcanology, flooding events and earthquakes. Scientific advances and innovations of several research teams around the world are presented from pre-events investigations to crisis management. More particularly, we emphasize the actual status of technology, methodologies and different applications that have emerged with the use of UAVs for each domain. It is shown that the deployment of UAVs in the geohazards context has experienced a tremendous increase during the last 10 years, with the development of more and more miniaturized, flexible and reliable systems. The use of such technology (UAV platform, instrumentation, methodologies) is different for each domain, depending on the spatial extent and the time scale of the observed phenomenon, but also on the practical constraints associated with the civil aviation agencies regulations (outside or within urban areas, before or during a crisis horizontal ellipsis ). This paper also highlights the use of recent methodologies associated with semi-automatic/automatic segmentation or deep learning for the processing of important amounts of data provided by UAVs.

However, the mechanisms by which these \"ridge-formers\" prevent erosion and preserve topography are not well described. Here we propose a new way to conceptualize the landscape-scale geomorphic function of ridge-forming lithologies, not only as units whose intermittent resistant outcrops slow erosion of ridgelines themselves, but as producers of large, durable boulders that litter adjacent hillslopes and channels, extending the caprock's resistant qualities to weaker underlying units and inhibiting channel incision over laterally extensive portions of the landscape. This conceptual model is based on observations of boulder distributions in the slowly-eroding Valley and Ridge province of the south-central Appalachian Mountains, and is in agreement with recent numerical models exploring the role of large boulders in channel and hillslope evolution. Though boulders are widely observed in the Valley and Ridge, boulder distributions have not generally been mapped, nor has their presence been linked to topographic persistence. To examine the potential link between resistant, ridge-derived boulders and relief preservation in the Valley and Ridge, we use UAV imagery and field observations to create detailed maps of boulder distributions along representative hillslopes and channels in SW Virginia, and document boulder appearance, size, and strength to make inferences about longevity and geomorphic function. We find that boulders cover significant portions of hillslopes (up to 9%) and are concentrated in channels (up to 90%). Boulders are very large (average size >1 m and up to 6 m diameter), indicating fluvial immobility and channel armoring, and often trap sediment upslope, indicating hillslope shielding. Boulders are entirely sourced from durable ridgeline lithologies, and exhibit features indicating longevity (e.g., fracturing, extensive lichen coverage, rounding). We interpret boulders to be relict from Pleistocene periglacial conditions, when intense freeze-thaw cycles likely enhanced boulder production. Our results are consistent with processes described in numerical models of boulder function and suggest that ridge-sourced boulders in this region play an important role in topographic preservation by stabilizing hillslopes and channels, challenging the idea that ridge-forming units primarily maintain relief by stabilizing the ridgelines themselves. In addition, the linkage of boulder production to a colder Pleistocene climate highlights a mechanism by which past climatic conditions may continue to impact landscape evolution after the transition to a new climatic regime.

The aim of this paper is to review the mainstream remote-sensing methods commonly employed for landslide assessment, as well as processing. The purpose is to understand how remote-sensing techniques can be useful for landslide hazard detection and monitoring taking into consideration several constraints such as field location or costs of surveys. First we focus on the suitability of terrestrial, aerial and spaceborne systems that have been widely used for landslide assessment to underline their benefits and drawbacks for data acquisition, processing and interpretation. Several examples of application are presented such as Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), lasergrammetry, Terrestrial Optical Photogrammetry. Some of these techniques are unsuitable for slow moving landslides, others limited to large areas and others to local investigations. It can be complicated to select the most appropriate system. Today, the key for understanding landslides is the complementarity of methods and the automation of the data processing.

This cleaning can be energy intensive and environmentally costly owing to the temperatures and the solvent load that are used. It is required throughout many industrial processes, notably surface finishing. This paper tests a novel technology that removes the need to heat the water, and reduces the need for additives, through use of a novel nozzle that uses just mains water and electricity to generate an 'Ultrasonically Activated Stream' (UAS). The UAS nozzle passes ultrasound down a stream of unheated water, and tests its ability to remove a variety of lubricants, from stainless steel, with and without the addition of degreaser, comparing it to the ability of the same water supply (when not ultrasonically activated) to remove the lubricant (with and without degreaser). Removal of the need to heat water by use of this UAS nozzle would reduce heating costs and allow areas of a plant or manufacturer that lack access to hot water to have enhanced cleaning. Reduction in the need to use additives reduces costs and is a requirement for surfaces that may be damaged by them. However, the implications extend further. If, in the current COVID-19 crisis, supply chains for solvents are broken, or additives and heating become difficult to access (for example to decontaminate PPE or an ambulance in the field), the ability to remove lubricant without heating (and, if necessary, additives such as detergents) is crucial, since the SARS-CoV-2 virus resides in respiratory secretions that are composed mainly of mucin glycoproteins, surfactant and intercellular fluid."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999895095825195}], "status": "success"}

While much research has focused on improving image classification by re-processing source images with more advanced algorithms and/or using images of finer resolution, there is rarely any systematic work on re-processing existing maps to increase their accuracy. We propose refining existing maps to achieve accuracy gains by exploring and utilizing relationships between reference data, which are often already available or can be collected, and map data. For this, we make novel use of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to analyze reference-map class co-occurrences to facilitate probabilistic re-classification of map classes in CCA ordination space, a synthesized feature space constrained by map class occurrence patterns. Experiments using GlobeLand30 land-cover (2010) over Wuhan, China were carried out using reference sample data collected previously for accuracy assessment in the same area. Reference sample data were stratified by map classes and their spatial heterogeneity. To examine effects of model-training sample size on refinements, three subset samples (360, 720, and 1480 pixels) were selected from a pool of 3000 sample pixels (the full training sample). Logistic regression modeling was employed as a baseline method for comparisons. Performance evaluation was based on a test sample of 1020 pixels using a strict and relaxed definitions of agreement between reference classification and map classification, resulting in measures of types I and II, respectively. It was found that the CCA-based method is more accurate than logistic regression in general. With increasing sample sizes, refinements generally lead to greater accuracy gains. Heterogeneous sub-strata usually see greater accuracy gains than in homogeneous sub-strata. It was also revealed that accuracy gains in specific strata (map classes and sub-strata) are related to strata refinability. Regarding CCA-based refinements, a relatively small sample of 360 pixels achieved a 3% gain in both overall accuracy (OA) and F(0.01)score (II).

Immobilization of male adults by chilling is a crucial process required for the packing, transportation and release of the mosquitoes during the implementation of IIT-SIT for mosquito control. In this study, effects of chilling on theAedes albopictusmales with tripleWolbachiainfections (HC line), a powerful weapon to fight against the wild typeAe.albopictuspopulation via IIT-SIT, were evaluated under both laboratory and field conditions. Irradiated HC (IHC) males were exposed to 1, 5 and 10 degrees C for 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24 h. The survival rate of the post-chilled IHC males was then monitored. Longevity of post-chilled IHC males was compared to non-chilled males under laboratory and semi-field conditions. Mating competitiveness of IHC/HC males after exposure to 5 or 10 degrees C for 0, 3 and 24 h was then evaluated. Effects of compaction and transportation under chilled conditions on the survival rate of IHC males were also monitored. The optimal chilling conditions for handling IHC males were temperatures between 5 and 10 degrees C for a duration of less than 3 h with no negative impacts on survival rate, longevity and mating competitiveness when compared to non-chilled males. However, the overall quality of post-chilled IHC/HC males decreased when exposed to low temperatures for 24 h. Reduced survival was observed when IHC males were stored at 5 degrees C under a compaction height of 8 cm. Transportation with chilling temperatures fluctuating from 8 to 12 degrees C has no negative impact on the survival of IHC males. This study identified the optimal chilling temperature and duration for the handling and transportation ofAe.albopictusIHC male adults without any detrimental effect on their survival, longevity and mating competitiveness. Further studies are required to develop drone release systems specific for chilled mosquitoes to improve release efficiency, as well as to compare the population suppression efficiency between release of post-chilled and non-chilled males in the field. Author summary Combining the incompatible insect technique (IIT) and sterile insect technique (SIT) is considered to be a promising approach to controlAedes albopictus, the world's most invasive mosquito species which can transmit dengue and zika. The combined IIT-SIT technique depends on the release of overflooding numbers of mass-reared male mosquitoes to sterilize female mosquitoes through mating, resulting in the reduction of the wild mosquito population. In existing SIT programs against agricultural pests, male insects are often immobilized by chilling to pack, transport and release them and thereby increase handling efficacy. Chilling for the immobilization of male mosquitoes may also improve program efficiency in the IIT-SIT against mosquitoes. Thus, it is essential to ascertain the optimal chilling conditions for handlingAe.albopictusmale mosquitoes. In this study, we found thatAe.albopictusmales could be chilled at 10 degrees C for 3 h without negative impacts on the biological qualities such as survival, longevity and mating competitiveness. Our results show that male mosquitoes could preserve a high level of quality under optimal chilling conditions, which indicates that immobilization by chilling is an important element for the combined IIT-SIT for mosquito control."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

To be realised, this would require the Very Low Level (VLL) urban airspace to be able to cope with high traffic densities of commercial delivery drones. The potential benefits of such novel drone-based applications are a reduction of traffic congestion in cities, lower greenhouse gas emissions and more efficient transportation operations. To help realise this concept, programs such as U-Space, the unmanned traffic management system for Europe, are developing important services such as deconfliction management and dynamic capacity management. However, for several of these services, design choices will depend on how, and how extensive they will be used.

On-screen digitalization and binary logistic regression (BLR) were applied to examine the status and determinants of farmland abandonment.

Almost 10.3% area of total land and 22.3% area of total farmland was abandoned in the Hill village. The Tarai village had the least farm abandonment (3.7%). Farmers perceived that climate change (less precipitation, increasing temperatures, and drought), shifting occupations, crops damaged by wildlife, migration, lack of irrigation, and a labor shortage are the leading determinants of farmland abandonment.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and very high- resolution (VHR) satellite imagery were used for detailed site recording and detection of coarse woody debris (CWD) objects under challenging Subarctic alpine woodlands conditions. UAVs enabled discovery of previously unknown wooden structures and revealed extensive use of CWD (n = 1745, total length = 2682 m, total volume = 16.7 m(3)). The methodology detected CWD objects much smaller than previously reported in remote sensing literature (mean 1.5 m long, 0.09 m wide), substantiating a high spatial resolution requirement for detection. Structurally, the fences were not uniformly left on the landscape. Permafrost patterned ground combined with small CWD contributions at the pixel level complicated identification through VHR data sets. UAV outputs significantly enriched field techniques and supported a deeper understanding of caribou fences as a hunting technology, and they will aid ongoing archaeological interpretation and time-series comparisons of change agents."}, "classification": [{"label": "false", "score": 0.9999963045120239}], "status": "success"}

In this study, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) based on a mesoscopic kinetic model was used to simulate the airflow field of a sixerotor plant protection drone. The airflow field of drone in hover and at varied flight speeds (1.0-5.0 m s(-1)) and various altitudes (1.5-3.5 m) was investigated. The characteristics of airflow separation, airflow coverage equivalent area and \"steep\" effect were investigated numerically.

Results indicate that the flight speed and altitude had a significant effect on the distribution of the airflow field. The predicted values in the vertical direction using the average velocity attenuation model (Y-DAVA) corresponded well with experimental measurements. The wake of airflow field had a significant backward tilt when the drone was flying forwards, thus when the flight speed was 4.0 m s(-1) and 5.0 m s(-1), the wake of the airflow field lifted off the ground, whereas the transverse separation appeared as horseshoe vortices.

For this reason, drone routing and scheduling has become a highly active area of research in recent years. Unlike the vehicle routing problem, however, designing drones' routes is challenging due to multiple operational characteristics including multi-trip operations, recharge planning, and energy consumption calculation. To fill some important gaps in the literature, this paper solves a multi-trip drone routing problem, where drones' energy consumption is modeled as a nonlinear function of payload and travel distance. We propose adding logical cuts and subgradient cuts in the solution process to tackle the more complex nonlinear (convex) energy function, instead of using the linear approximation method as in the literature, which can fail to detect infeasible routes due to excess energy consumption. We use a 2-index formulation to model the problem and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm for the formulation. Benchmark instances are first generated for this problem. Numerical tests indicate that even though the original model is nonlinear, the proposed approach can solve large problems to optimality. In addition, in multiple instances, the linear approximation model yields routes that under the nonlinear energy model would be energy infeasible. Use of a linear approximation for drone energy leads to differences in energy consumption of about 9% on average compared to the nonlinear energy model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to transfer the search and rescue information quickly and efficiently, two types of UAVs, the ferrying UAVs and the searching UAVs, are used to complete the mission. Obviously, this application scenario requires an efficient path planning method for ferrying UAVs. The existing path planning methods for ferrying UAVs usually focus on shortening the path length and ignore the different initial energy of ferrying UAVs. However, the following problem does exist: if the ferrying UAV with less initial energy is assigned a longer path, meaning that the ferrying UAV with less initial energy will ferry messages for more searching UAVs. When the lower-initial-energy ferrying UAV is running out of energy, more searching UAVs will no longer deliver messages successfully. Therefore, the mismatch between the planned path length and the initial energy will eventually result in a lower global message delivery ratio. To solve this problem, we propose a new concept energy-factor for a ferrying UAV and use the variance of all ferrying UAVs' energy-factor to measure the balance between the planned path length and the initial energy. Further, we model the energy-balanced path-planning problem for multiple ferrying UAVs, which actually is a multiobject optimization problem of minimizing the planned path length and minimizing the variance of all ferrying UAVs' energy-factor. Based on the genetic algorithm, we design and implement an energy-balanced path planning algorithm (EMTSPA) for multiple ferrying UAVs to solve this multiobject optimization problem.

We developed a novel, semi-automated approach for detecting salmon redds by applying machine learning classification and object detection techniques to UAS-based imagery. We found that both true colour (RGB) and hyperspectral imagery could be used to identify salmon redds, though with varying degrees of accuracy. Redds were mapped with accuracies of similar to 0.75 from RGB imagery using logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) classification algorithms, but this type of data could not be used to identify redds using Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA). The hyperspectral imagery was more useful for mapping salmon redds, with accuracies greater than 0.9 for both logistic regression and SVM classifiers; OBIA of the hyperspectral data resulted in redd detection accuracies up to 0.86. The hyperspectral imagery also yielded complementary physical habitat information including water depth and substrate composition, which we quantified on the basis of a spectrally based chlorophyll absorption ratio.

NDVI plant variability was correctly addressed considering the three parameters as random effects showing small root-mean-square error. Resampling analysis proved that a suitable accuracy parameter estimation can be performed with fewer individuals (plants) which might represent an agricultural experimental design with fewer experimental units.

A growing number of studies seek to gauge the public's risk beliefs about drone delivery and inform policy development before its widespread uptake. Complicating these efforts is the fact that beliefs are interconnected and embedded in a cognitive system. This article argues that public outcomes are not based on atomized and isolated beliefs about risks involved in drone delivery, but instead emerge from the patterns in the relationships among these expressed beliefs. However, little is known about the structural characteristics of risk belief systems related to drone delivery, and the implications for risk communication and management. In an effort to fill this void, we conducted a network analysis of risk beliefs about drone delivery based on nationally representative data (N = 1465). The results revealed structural connections among 11 risk beliefs and explored structural variations in the risk belief system between people with different attitudes toward drone delivery. The simulation results showed that risk-mitigating messages instigated greater changes to the public's risk perceptions when they targeted structurally central, as opposed to peripheral, risk beliefs.

In this paper, we focus on a multi-UAV assisted wireless network, and target to fully utilize the benefits of wireless caching and UAV mobility for multiuser content delivery. By taking into account the limited storage, our goal is to maximize the minimum throughput among UAV-served users by jointly optimizing cache placement, UAV trajectory, and transmission power in a finite period. The resultant problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To facilitate solving this problem, an alternating iterative algorithm is proposed by adopting the block alternating descent and successive convex approximation methods. Specifically, this problem is split into three subproblems, namely cache placement optimization, trajectory optimization, and power allocation optimization. Then these subproblems are solved alternately in an iterative manner. We show that the proposed algorithm can converge to the set of stationary solutions of this problem.

Thus, a dense cooperation between the CF and the CNN still remains less discovered and the question of how to effectively join both techniques to further boost the tracking performance is still open. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a collaborative architecture which incorporates models constructed with both techniques and dynamically aggregates their response maps for target inference. By an alternating optimization, both models are learned on each other's errors to persistently improve the classification power of the whole tracker. For further efficiency, we present a faster solver for our utilized CF and an analytical solution for dynamic model weighting.

In particular, a leader-follower synchronization technique scheme is presented for drone rendezvous and consists of forcing one drone (leader) to be above the other (follower) for parcel relay. In this scenario, no assumptions on the availability of a dynamic model for the leader drone are made, only its position and attitude are available for feedback to the follower drone. Considering the effect of unknown variation of the parcel load, a finite-time tracking control algorithm via output-feedback is designed for the follower drone while guaranteeing that the input constraints for the drones are satisfied. To conquer the challenge faced with the underactuation property of the drone, a decoupling method is adopted in order to view the drone UAV as a cascade structure of two fully actuated subsystems. A fixed-time sliding mode surface is therefore utilized in the control procedure of the attitude tracking of the drone to cope with the disturbances and model uncertainties.

A natural and important question arises: What is the impact of a drone delivery system (DDS) on a retailer's extant logistics parameters, for example, the number of customer-facing delivery centers (last-mile warehouses) it uses and delivery lead times it offers? On the one hand, the ability to reach customers faster than through traditional means argues for more centralization of delivery services. On the other hand, more decentralization can allow the retailer to offer hitherto unheard-of delivery lead times and thereby spur demand. We show that, as drone technology matures and becomes more cost-effective, delivery networks will become increasingly decentralized while delivering products at faster speeds. While perfect delivery customization-under which each demand location is offered a customized delivery guarantee-is theoretically feasible under a DDS, it may not be practical to implement such a finely differentiated delivery strategy. Instead, we show that retailers can recover a significant portion of the profit under this ideal scenario by offering limited delivery-time customization, that is, partitioning the market into a few delivery \"zones\" and offering the best feasible delivery guarantee for each zone. In physically congested metropolitan markets, where retailers may be forced to operate with only a few delivery centers, it may be optimal to operate a DDS by offering delivery guarantees that are inferior to the best possible in order to throttle unprofitable demand. In such markets, the effectiveness of limited delivery-time customization increases as the extent of physical congestion increases."}, "classification": [{"label": "true", "score": 0.9999871253967285}], "status": "success"}

Every minute delay in defibrillation results in a 7% to 10% reduction in survival. This is particularly problematic in rural and remote regions, where emergency medical service response is prolonged and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are often not available. Our primary objective was to examine the feasibility of a novelAEDdrone delivery method for rural and remote sudden cardiac arrest. A secondary objective was to compare response times betweenAEDdrone delivery and ambulance to mock sudden cardiac arrest resuscitations. Methods and Results We conducted 6 simulations in 2 rural communities in southern Ontario, Canada. In the first 2 simulations, the drone and ambulance were dispatched from the same paramedic base. In simulations 3 and 4, the drone and ambulance were dispatched from separate paramedic bases; and in simulations 5 and 6, the drone was dispatched from an optimized location. During each simulation, a \"mock\" call was placed to 911 and a singleAEDdrone and an ambulance were simultaneously dispatched to a predetermined destination. On scene, trained first responders retrieved theAEDfrom the drone and initiated resuscitative efforts on a mannequin until paramedics arrived. No difficulties were encountered during drone activation by dispatch, ascent, landing, or bystander retrieval of theAEDfrom the drone. During simulations 1 and 2, the distance to the scene was 6.6 km. For simulations 3 and 4, the ambulance response distance increased to 8.8 km while drone remained at 6.6 km; and in simulations 5 and 6, the ambulance response distance was 20 km compared with 9 km for the drone. During each flight, theAEDdrone arrived on scene before the ambulance, between 1.8 and 8.0 minutes faster. Conclusions This study suggestsAEDdrone delivery is feasible, with the potential for improvements in response time during simulated sudden cardiac arrest scenarios. Further research is required to determine the appropriate system configuration forAEDdrone delivery in an integrated emergency medical service system as well as optimal strategies to simplify bystander application of a drone-deliveredAED."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Methods This retrospective study involved women who had laser surgery for TTTS between January 2012 and May 2018 at a single institution. The prevalence of an RVOTA in either twin was compared among TTTS cases in which both twins had positive end-diastolic flow (EDF) in the UA and those in which either twin had intermittent or persistent absent/reversed UA EDF. Nonparametric tests were used for comparisons. Logistic regression was performed to identify variables associated with an RVOTA in either twin, adjusted for moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, the Quintero stage, and other confounders.P < .05 was considered significant. Results A total of 126 consecutive TTTS cases were included. Right ventricular outflow tract abnormalities were seen in 8.7% (11of 126) of cases, all in recipient twins. Significant differences in the rate of RVOTAs in the recipient twin were seen between TTTS cases with intermittent absent/reversed UA EDF and those with positive UA EDF (26.9% [7 of 26] versus 3.7% [3 of 82];P= .002].

It was found that the bedding characteristics, presence of well-developed joints, and properties of the weak interlayers were the internal factors inducing the rockslide. The free face in front of the slope, the weak interlayer with low shear strength, and the through-going joint that formed the back boundary of slope constituted the boundary of the rockslide. The combined effects of improper slope excavation and concentrated rainfall were external factors that directly triggered the rockslide.

Innovative interventions such as unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) and digital adherence monitoring technologies have the potential to enhance patient-centric quality tuberculosis care and help challenged National Tuberculosis Programs leapfrog over the impediments of conventional Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS) implementation. A bundle of innovative interventions referred to for its delivery technology as the Drone Observed Therapy System (DrOTS) was implemented in remote Madagascar. Given the potentially increased cost these interventions represent for health systems, a cost-effectiveness analysis was indicated. Methods A decision analysis model was created to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the DrOTS strategy compared to DOTS, the standard of care, in a study population of 200,000 inhabitants in rural Madagascar with tuberculosis disease prevalence of 250/100,000. A mixed top-down and bottom-up costing approach was used to identify costs associated with both models, and net costs were calculated accounting for resulting TB treatment costs. Net cost per disability-adjusted life years averted was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed for key input variables to identify main drivers of health and cost outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Findings Net cost per TB patient identified within DOTS and DrOTS were, respectively, $282 and $1,172. The incremental cost per additional TB patient diagnosed in DrOTS was $2,631 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DrOTS compared to DOTS was $177 per DALY averted. Analyses suggest that integrating drones with interventions ensuring highly sensitive laboratory testing and high treatment adherence optimizes cost-effectiveness. Conclusion Innovative technology packages including drones, digital adherence monitoring technologies, and molecular diagnostics for TB case finding and retention within the cascade of care can be cost effective. Their integration with other interventions within health systems may further lower costs and support access to universal health coverage."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Due to its advantages of being fast, convenient, and safe, drone delivery can, to a certain extent, solve the problems of rider delivery. However, can drone delivery completely replace rider delivery? The paper mainly uses the prospect theory to discuss the conditions under which drone delivery is superior to rider delivery based on four factors: delivery distance, degree of rider delay, pickup time, and consumer attitudes towards drone delivery. Based on the research, it was found that when the delivery distance is more than 7 kilometres, the pickup time is within 2 minutes, or when consumers accept drone delivery, drone delivery is better than rider delivery. When the rider's delay caused the delivery time to increase by more than 20%, the advantages of drone delivery began to stand out. Moreover, research has proven that drone delivery will help expand the scope of instant delivery, and the rational layout of drone airports and strengthening of consumer awareness and friendliness towards drone delivery will also help promote the development of drone delivery."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Unfortunately, attempts to collect blow from small cetaceans have not been successful due to their swimming and diving behavior. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study we investigated the application of a specific sampling tool attached to a UAV to analyze the blow from small cetaceans and their respiratory microbiome. Preliminary trials to set up the sampling tool were conducted on a group of 6 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, housed at Acquario di Genova, with approximately 1 meter distance between the blowing animal and the tool to obtain suitable samples. The same sampling kit, suspended via a 2 meter rope assembled on a waterproof UAV, flying 3 meters above the animals, was used to sample the blows of 5 wild bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia (Greece) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), to investigate whether this experimental assembly also works for large whale sampling. In order to distinguish between blow-associated microbes and seawater microbes, we pooled 5 seawater samples from the same area where blow samples' collection were carried out. The the respiratory microbiota was assessed by using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene via Illumina Amplicon Sequencing. The pooled water samples contained more bacterial taxa than the blow samples of both wild animals and the sequenced dolphin maintained under human care. The composition of the bacterial community differed between the water samples and between the blow samples of wild cetaceans and that under human care, but these differences may have been mediated by different microbial communities between seawater and aquarium water. The sperm whale's respiratory microbiome was more similar to the results obtained from wild bottlenose dolphins. Although the number of samples used in this study was limited and sampling and analyses were impaired by several limitations, the results are rather encouraging, as shown by the evident microbial differences between seawater and blow samples, confirmed also by the meta-analysis carried out comparing our results with those obtained in previous studies. Collecting exhaled air from small cetaceans using drones is a challenging process, both logistically and technically. The success in obtaining samples from small cetacean blow in this study in comparison to previous studies is likely due to the distance the sampling kit is suspended from the drone, which reduced the likelihood that the turbulence of the drone propeller interfered with successfully sampling blow, suggested as a factor leading to poor success in previous studies."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

A similar relationship does not exist for convective turbulence. In this paper, we propose an analytical expression relating epsilon and C-T(2) in the convective boundary layer (CBL), by taking into account the effects of nonlocal heat transport under convective conditions using the Deardorff countergradient model. Measurements using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-frequency response sensors to measure velocity and temperature fluctuations obtained during the two field campaigns conducted at Shigaraki MU observatory in June 2016 and 2017 are used to test this relationship between epsilon and C-T(2) in the CBL. The selection of CBL cases for analysis was aided by auxiliary measurements from additional sensors (mainly radars), and these are described. Comparison with earlier results in the literature suggests that the proposed relationship works, if the counter gradient term gamma(D) in the Deardorff model, which is proportional to the ratio of the variances of potential temperature theta and vertical velocity w, is evaluated from in situ (airplane and UAV) observational data, but fails if evaluated from large-eddy simulation (LES) results. This appears to be caused by the tendency of the variance of theta in the upper part of the CBL and at the bottom of the entrainment zone to be underestimated by LES relative to in situ measurements from UAVs and aircraft.

This work investigates the effects of navigation on bank erosion along a reach of the regulated Meuse River with recently renaturalized banks. We apply UAV-SfM photogrammetry, RTK-GPS, acoustic Doppler velocimetry, aerial and terrestrial photography, soil tests, and multibeam echosounding to analyze the progression of bank retreat after riprap removal. After having analyzed the effects of ship-generated waves and currents, floods, and vegetation dynamics, a process-based model is proposed to estimate the long-term bank retreat. The results show that a terrace evolves in length and depth across the bank according to local lithology, which we clustered in three types. Floods contribute to upper-bank erosion-inducing mass failures, while near-bank flow appears increasingly ineffective to remove the failed material due to terrace elongation. Vegetation growth at the upper-bank toe reduces bank failure and delays erosion, but its permanence is limited by terrace stability and efficiency to dissipate waves.

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of environmental variables on FLIR-based techniques for arctic bear den detection. Using a FLIR-equipped unmanned aircraft system (UAS), we conducted observations of artificial polar bear (APD) and grizzly bear (AGD) dens from horizontal and vertical perspectives between December 2016 and April 2017. We recorded physical characteristics of artificial dens and weather conditions present during each observation. We captured 291 images and classified each as detection or nondetection based on the number of pixels representative of a den \"hot spot.\" We used logistic regression to model the effects of four weather variables on the odds of detection (detection). We found that UAS-FLIR detects APDs two times better than AGDs, and that for both species detections are four times more likely from the vertical than horizontal perspective. Lower air temperature and wind speed, and the absence of precipitation and sunlight increased detection for APDs. A 1 degrees C increase in air temperature lowered detection by 12% for APDs and by 8% for AGDs.

In our approach, multiple UAVs cooperatively transport the data in a store-and-forward fashion along minimum latency paths (MLPs) to guarantee data delivery within a predefined latency bound. Additionally, MLPs specify a lower bound for any latency minimization problem where multiple mobile agents transport data in a store-and-forward fashion. We introduce three variations of a heuristic employing MLPs and compare their performance with an uncooperative approach in a simulation study. The results show that cooperative data transport reduces the information idleness at the base station compared to the uncooperative approach where data is transported individually by the UAVs."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

We therefore investigated the effects of valproate on fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism in HepaRG cells, a human hepatoma cell line. In previously fatty acid loaded HepaRG cells, valproate impaired lipid droplet disposal starting at 1 mM after incubation for 3 or 7 days. Valproate increased the expression of genes associated with fatty acid import and triglyceride synthesis, but did not relevantly affect expression of genes engaged in fatty acid activation. Valproate impaired mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism by inhibiting beta-ketothiolase and the function of the electron transport chain, which was associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Valproate increased the mitochondrial DNA copy number per HepaRG cell, possibly as a consequence of impaired mitochondrial function. Valproate decreased the hepatocellular mRNA and protein expression of the fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) and of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) at 1 mM and increased the hepatocellular concentration of free fatty acids. Furthermore, valproate decreased protein expression and excretion of ApoB100 in HepaRG cells at 1 mM, reflecting impaired formation and excretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). In conclusion, valproate increased the hepatocellular triglyceride content by multiple mechanisms, whereby impaired expression of FABP1 and MTTP as well as impaired VLDL formation and excretion appeared to be dominant. Valproate caused cell death mainly by apoptosis, which may be a consequence of mitochondrial oxidative stress and increased hepatocellular concentration of free fatty acids."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective routing algorithm for FANETs. In addition to the basic transmission performance in the construction of the routing path, the network impact according to the mobility of the UAV nodes and the energy state of each node should be considered because of the characteristics of the FANET, and the overall efficiency and safety of the network should be satisfied. We therefore propose the use of Q-learning-based fuzzy logic for the FANET routing protocol. The proposed algorithm facilitates the selection of the routing paths to be processed in terms of link and overall path performances. The optimal routing path to the destination is determined by each UAV using a fuzzy system with link- and path-level parameters. The link-level parameters include the transmission rate, energy state, and flight status between neighbor UAVs, while the path-level parameters include the hop count and successful packet delivery time. The path-level parameters are dynamically updated by the reinforcement learning method. In the simulation results, we compared the proposal with the conventional fuzzy logic and Q-value-based ad hoc on-demand distance vector.

However, if the parcel is too large, this will result in an obstruction of the propeller slipstream, incurring significant drag. As such, the parcel's location below the rotor plane limits the size of parcels that can be delivered, specifically super-sized parcels that protrude beyond the bounds of the four rotors. Delivering these large parcels requires bigger drone platforms, which consequently consume more energy, necessitate large storage spaces, and are less portable. In this letter, we propose an alternative approach, placing the parcel above the rotor plane. However, placing a parcel above a quadcopter encounters two main challenges. The first is the optimal position of the CG to maintain stability of the drone. Second is the aerodynamic influence on the lift of the drone with a parcel is placed above the propellers. To address these challenges, aerodynamic characterization experiments were performed and a new drone design was proposed. This letter presents a prototype quadcopter design solution that places the parcel above the propellers to enable delivery of super-sized parcels, as well as a compact rotor design configuration for lower storage cost and increased portability. The new approach of placing an over-sized parcel above propellers provides the 82% increase in thrust over putting the parcel below the propellers."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Describing geography and spatial relationships is, therefore, challenging using analytics for planning and management. A critical aspect of spatial description has to do with allocation, a process of determining who is best served by which facility. Allocation is useful in reflecting customer behavior, efficient assignment, districting, etc. Even though spatial and temporal heterogeneity is part of assignment processes formalized in allocation problems, previous studies often assume a pre-specified network. The assumption is understandable since many service vehicles currently travel over road networks. However, there are some other vehicles, such as planes, unmanned aircraft vehicles, boats, ships, etc. Their access is not restricted to a network. How to structure and solve an allocation process is particularly challenging when heterogeneity must be taken into account across continuous space and through time. In this paper, a method is developed to construct service areas in order to minimize assignment cost in a continuous region where accessibility is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Application findings are reported for planning problems involving emergency drone delivery since it is impacted by heterogeneity in the local environment. The travel accessibility of drones changes due to time-varying wind and airspace restrictions. Results show that the optimal allocation and service area of drone-based stations vary over time. The response time (or system costs) can be saved by taking into account wind and travel obstacles. Further, feasibility, practicality, and importance are demonstrated for incorporating spatial and temporal heterogeneity in continuous space allocation processes."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The drone cage is made of a dense and lightweight grid. When flying in proximity of humans, the arms and propellers are retracted and fully sealed within the cage, thus making the drone safe and also reducing the total footprint.

In this scheme, drones are distributed regarding the predicted terrestrial traffic condition in order to efficiently alleviate the inevitable problems of conventional VANETs, such as building obstacle, isolated vehicles, and uneven traffic loading.

In this study, we attempted to measure vertical profiles of boundary layer ozone in the winter of 2018 over the Yangtze River Delta region of China, using a hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. A commercial portable ozone monitor mounted in a thermal insulation box was attached to the UAV platform to conduct vertical ozone measurements. The results showed that the UAV platform could effectively capture the vertical variations of boundary layer ozone in wintertime. During the field campaign, surface ozone was in relatively low levels due to weak photochemical production. In the daytime, the ozone was well mixed within the boundary layer. At nighttime, uniform vertical distribution patterns and stratified distribution patterns were frequently obtained in ozone profiles below 500 m. Backward trajectories and wind profiles were used to investigate the horizontal and vertical transport of ozone. The stratified distribution patterns of ozone were closely associated with strong contemporary advection transport of ozone that was accompanied by enhanced winds aloft. Besides, strong wind shear enhanced the downward transport of ozone from the free troposphere into the boundary layer, leading to uniform vertical distribution patterns of boundary layer ozone and the elevated nocturnal surface ozone levels.

This research introduces a new routing model that considers a synchronized truck-drone operation by allowing multiple drones to fly from a truck, serve one or multiple customers, and return to the same truck for a battery swap and package retrieval. The model addresses two levels (echelons) of delivery: primary truck routing from the main depot to serve assigned customers and secondary drone routing from the truck, which behaves like a moveable intermediate depot to serve other sets of customers. The model takes into account both trucks' and drones' capacities with the objective of finding optimal mutes of both trucks and drones that minimizes the total arrival time of both trucks and drones at the depot after completing the deliveries. The problem can be solved by formulated mixed integer programming (MIP) for the small-size problem, and two efficient heuristic algorithms are designed to solve the large-size problems: Drone Truck Route Construction (DTRC) and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS).

We studied the relationships between geomorphic features, soils, biomass of above-ground vegetation (biomass) and soil organic carbon storage (SOCS) to further enhance our understanding of geomorphological processes, soil formation and evaluating SOCS in this strongly dissected landscape. Based on the previous knowledge, the effect of slope aspect on differentiation of soils is considerable in the studied area. Therefore, slope aspect was included as a phase of the geomorphic surface (PGS) in the geomorphic hierarchy to better analyze and understand the soil variation and development. A total of 220 soil samples were taken in different PGS from three depths 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm. For additional details, biomass sampling was collected on 1 m(2) quadrat in every location where the soil samples were taken. Results showed that the 0-20 cm layer with 2.13 kg m(-2) had the maximum amount of SOC density (SOCD). Among studied units, moderately flat plain (VA111), loess tableland (TB111) and middle hill with north aspect (Hi211_2) had the highest SOCD compared to other units in the three studied depths. The results also indicated that PGS Hi211_2 had a significantly higher SOCD and biomass than PGS middle hill with south aspect (Hi211_1) in three soil layers. The highest values of SOCS were similarly found in the surface soil layer of PGS Hi211_2 accounting for 42816.55 Mg equal to 36.84% of total SOCS. In all PGSs, there were a positive significant correlations between biomass and SOCD (r(2) = 0.62, p = 0.01, n = 80). Therefore, the present study revealed that the variation of SOCD is mainly controlled by the PGS in hillslope landscape. Findings of SOCS denoted the importance of protecting surface and subsurface soil layers in hillslope to store SOC. In general, an accurate understanding of geomorphic surface is needed to accurately estimate SOCS, biomass and to evaluate soil and ecosystem related effects on global warming of ecologically sensitive semi-arid areas."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Stage 1 (2009-2013) commenced with the onshore migration and attachment of a swash bar, followed by persistent spit accretion updrift of the bar and erosion downdrift because of the slow speed of bar migration in this large tidal-range environment. In stage 2 (2013-2016), three overwash events and a 220 m-wide breach culminating in the total destruction of the spit during winter 2015-2016 involved the landward mobilization of thousands of cubic metres of sand. These events occurred during short durations (a few hours) when spring high tides coincided with relatively energetic waves, underscoring the importance of storms in rapid spit morphological change. Strong spring tidal currents maintained the breach. Stage 3 (2016-2019) has involved new hook construction through welding of a swash bar and spit longshore extension, highlighting the resilience of the spit over the 10-year period, and involving a positive sediment balance of 244 000 m(3). The three stages bring out, by virtue of the temporal density of LiDAR and UAV data used, a high detail of spit evolution relative to earlier studies in this macrotidal setting. The large tidal range strongly modulates the role of waves and wave-generated longshore currents, the main process drivers of spit evolution, by favouring long periods of inertia in the course of the spring-neap tidal cycle, but also brief episodes of significant morphological change when storm waves coincide with spring high tides.

The train, an already existing mobile platform in our neighbourhood, follows its normal predefined route and timetable to transport passengers. In the meanwhile, some parcels to be delivered to some customers and a delivery drone are stored on its roof. The drone can launch from the train, deliver the parcel to a customer, and return to the train. It can also travel with the train and replace its battery on the roof via an automatic battery swap system. As the parcel delivery system cannot manage the movement of the train, the route and the timetable of the train need to be accounted carefully to schedule the deliveries. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total delivery time of a given set of parcels, and we propose two algorithms. Though the exact algorithm gives the optimal schedule, its computational complexity is exponential to the number of parcels. To make the proposed system possible to be implemented in practice, a suboptimal algorithm is developed, which is more efficient than the exact algorithm and can achieve close performance with the exact algorithm. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective strategy to deal with the uncertainty associated with the train's timetable. Moreover, the proposed algorithm for the single drone case is modified to deal with the multiple drone case. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified via computer simulations and comparison with existing methods. The results show that the presented approach is more cost-efficient than the Truck only scheme and the Truck plus Drone scheme. Moreover, the parcel delivery time can be reduced and the delivery area can be enlarged compared to the scheme using drones only."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

It is a reasonable alternative to other techniques in order to shorten procedural time and decrease perioperative complications. However, in this context, the short-axis (out-of-plane) visualization to guide the vein puncture is the most used technique. The aim of our study is to describe a single-center experience with the US long-axis (in-plane) technique defining predictors of unsuccessful puncture attempts and failure to axillary vein cannulation in a cohort of patients undergoing CIEDs procedures. Methods From November 2017 to June 2019, consecutive patients undergoing CIEDs procedures were enrolled in the study. US-guided long axis (in-plane) view to guide axillary vein cannulation was used in all subjects. Unsuccessful puncture attempts (UAs) and complete failures to cannulate the vein were collected for each procedure. All patients were evaluated on a daily basis until hospital discharge and at 1-month follow up visit. Results Among 119 subjects (M: F = 75:44), mean age was 79 +/- 9 years, mean BMI 25.7 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), and mean BSA 1.74 +/- 0.4 m(2). We placed 95 pacemakers (32 single-, 61 dual-, and 2 triple-chamber) and 20 ICDs (7 single, 6 dual, 7 triple chambers). An upgrade from dual-chamber to triple-chamber device was carried out with the addition of a new lead in 3 patients. During a system revision, one new electrode was implanted. The overall leads inserted were 204. There were 33 initial unsuccessful attempts in 22/119 patients. US-guided axillary access was finally successful in 94.9% of patients (113/119). In the other cases (6/119), cephalic vein was isolated or blinded subclavian puncture was performed. Interestingly, at univariate analysis, an increasing BMI and BSA, male sex, and anticoagulant therapy were predictors of unsuccessful attempts or failure to cannulate the vein with US. Among those subjects, the multivariate logistic regression showed significant correlations only between BMI and unsuccessful attempts: odds ratio (OR) = 1.16,p = 0.009 [95% CI = 1.04-1.31], and BMI with failure to cannulate the vein: OR = 1.21,p = 0.03 [95%CI = 1.01-1.45]. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves individuated the best BMI value cutoff point at 27 kg/m(2)(area under the curve [AUC]: 68.6%) having a sensitivity of 63.6% and a specificity of 66.5% for unsuccessful puncture attempts; a BMI value of 28 kg/m(2)(AUC 74.9%) had a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 66.7% for failure to cannulate the vein with the US-guided approach. Conclusions Axillary vein long-axis (in-plane) US-guided cannulation during CIEDs implantation is characterized by a high success rate (94.9%). An elevated BMI is significantly related to unsuccessful puncture attempts or failure to cannulation. The higher is the BMI, the more are the chances to have difficult vein puncture or cannulation failure and to switch from US-guided approach to another technique."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

A novel channel precoder predictor is proposed, in which the prediction is conducted on a non-linear vector space-Grassmannian manifold. The predictor at the receiver utilizes the current and previous channel matrices to solve the precoder at the next time and then feeds it back to the transmitter for precoding. More specifically, two sub-matrices are extracted from the channel right singular matrices and modeled as two points on the Grassmannian manifold. Then, the geodesic between the two points is conducted. Unlike the conventional method in which the tangent vector at the previous point is parallel transported along the geodesic, we predict the next point by use of the geodesic equation directly. We analyze the computational complexity of the proposed method and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method by comparing with the conventional one. Besides, we adopt a general Ricean channel model in the UAV MIMO system, where both the Kronecker model and Jake's model are incorporated. The effects of various channel model parameters on the system performance in terms of the chordal error of channel predictor and the optimum step are thoroughly investigated."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

In particular, the chosen aerial platform is an omnidirectional quadrotor, which, by exploiting two additional actuators, has the capability to produce an omnidirectional total thrust by changing the orientation of the plane of the rotors. Since it is assumed that the object geometry and dynamic parameters are not known, the devised strategy includes a first stage in which the robots cooperatively estimate the object parameters and a second stage in which such parameters are adopted in an impedance control, aimed at limiting both the contact wrenches, due to the object/environment interaction, and the internal wrenches, due to the robot/object interaction. More in detail, two admittance filters are designed to determine the reference trajectory for the object (external impedance) and for the aerial vehicles (internal impedance).

The DFN analysis allows for reliable characterization and reproduction of the most relevant features of fracture networks, including: identification of orientation sets and their characteristics (mean orientation, dispersion, and prior probability); scale invariance in distributions of fracture length and spatial location/clustering; and the distribution of aperture values used to compute network-scale equivalent permeability. A two-dimensional DFN-generation approach honors field data by explicitly reproducing observed multi-scale fracture clustering using a multiplicative cascade process and power law distribution of fracture length. The influence of aperture on network-scale equivalent permeability is investigated using comparisons between a sublinear aperture-to-length relationship and constant aperture. To assess the applicability of the developed methodology, DFN flow simulations are calibrated to pumping test data. Results suggest that even at small scales, UAV surveys capture the essential geometrical properties required for fluid flow characterization. Both the constant and sublinear aperture scaling approaches provide good matches to the pumping test results with only minimal calibration, indicating that the reproduced networks sufficiently capture the geometric and connectivity properties characteristic of the granitic rocks at the study site.

The purpose of this paper is to establish a simple experimental procedure to calibrate pitch instrumentation and classical control algorithms. This includes developing an efficient pitch angle observer with optimal estimation and evaluating controllers under uncertainty and external disturbances. Design/methodology/approach A wind tunnel test bench is designed to simulate fixed-wing aircraft dynamics. Key elements of the instrumentation commonly found inMAVsare characterized in a gyroscopic test bench. A data fusion algorithm is calibrated to match the gyroscopic test bench measurements and is then integrated into the autopilot platform. The elevator-angle to pitch-angle dynamic model is obtained experimentally. Two different control algorithms, based on model-free and model-based approaches, are designed. These controllers are analyzed in terms of parametric uncertainties due to wind speed variations and external perturbation because of sudden weight distribution changes. A series of experimental tests is performed in wind-tunnel facilities to highlight the main features of each control approach. Findings With regard to the instrumentation algorithms, a simple experimental methodology for the design of optimal pitch angle observer is presented and validated experimentally. In the context of the platform design and identification, the similitude among the theoretical and experimental responses shows that the platform is suitable for typical pitch control assessment. The wind tunnel experiments show that a fixed linear controller, designed using classical frequency domain concepts, is able to provide adequate responses in scenarios that approximate the operation ofMAVs. Research limitations/implications The aircraft orientation observer can be used for both pitch and roll angles. However, for simultaneousyaw angle estimation the proposed design method requires further research. The model analysis considers a wind speed range of 6-18 m/s, with a nominal operation of 12 m/s. The maximum experimentally tested reference for the pitch angle controller was 20 degrees. Further operating conditions may require more complex control approaches (e.g. scheduling, non-linear, etc.). However, this operating range is enough for typicalMAVmissions. Originality/value The study shows the design of an effective pitch angle observer, based on a simple experimental approach, which achieved locally optimum estimates at the test conditions. Additionally, the instrumentation and design of a test bench for typical pitch control assessment in wind tunnel facilities is presented. Finally, the study presents the development of a simple controller that provides adequate responses in scenarios that approximate the operation ofMAVs, including perturbations that resemble package delivery and parametric uncertainty due to wind speed variations."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

With recent humanitarian field tests of cargo UAVs as indication that implementation may soon become reality, a priori assessment of a smart-navigated (autonomous) UAV disaster cargo fleet via simulation modeling and analysis is vital to the best-practice development process. Logistical problems with ground transport of relief supplies in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (2017) pose a compelling use scenario for UAV disaster cargo delivery. In this context, we introduce a General Purpose Assessment Model (GPAM) that can estimate the potential effectiveness of a cargo UAV fleet for any given response region. We evaluate this model using the following standards: (i) realistic specifications; (ii) stable output for various realistic specifications; and (iii) support of humanitarian goals. To this end, we discuss data from humanitarian cargo delivery field tests and feedback from practitioners, perform sensitivity analyses, and demonstrate the advantage of using humanitarian rather than geographic distance in making fleet delivery assignments. We conclude with several major challenges faced by those who wish to implement smart-navigated UAV cargo fleets in disaster response, and the need for further GPAM development.

Measurements of drifting and blowing snow for improving process understanding and model validation are typically limited to point measurements at meteorological stations, providing no information on the spatial variability of horizontal mass fluxes or even the vertically integrated mass flux. We present a promising application of a compact and low-cost radar system for measuring and characterizing larger-scale (hundreds of metres) snow redistribution processes, specifically blowing snow off a mountain ridge. These measurements provide valuable information of blowing snow velocities, frequency of occurrence, travel distances and turbulence characteristics. Three blowing snow events are investigated, two in the absence of precipitation and one with concurrent precipitation. Blowing snow velocities measured with the radar are validated by comparison against wind velocities measured with a 3D ultra-sonic anemometer. A minimal blowing snow travel distance of 60-120 m is reached 10-20 % of the time during a snow storm, depending on the strength of the storm event. The relative frequency of transport distances decreases exponentially above the minimal travel distance, with a maximum measured distance of 280 m. In a first-order approximation, the travel distance increases linearly with the wind velocity, allowing for an estimate of a threshold wind velocity for snow particle entrainment and transport of 7.5-8.8 m s(-1), most likely depending on the prevailing snow cover properties. Turbulence statistics did not allow a conclusion to be drawn on whether low-level, low-turbulence jets or highly turbulent gusts are more effective in transporting blowing snow over longer distances, but highly turbulent flows are more likely to bring particles to greater heights and thus influence cloud processes. Drone-based photogrammetry measurements of the spatial snow height distribution revealed that increased snow accumulation in the lee of the ridge is the result of the measured local blowing snow conditions."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The mobile users use the cellular devices to raise the content requests. Additionally, multiple UAVs act as aerial base stations to deliver the requested contents to ground-based mobile users. The proposed work aims to maximize the QoE. Additionally, the existingworks do not consider the necessity of creating groups of ground-based mobile users based on geographic locations in order to provide contents seamlessly. Therefore, we construct an optimization problem to maximize the average CDI, which is proved as an NP-hard problem. Further, multiple UAVs incur the challenges of placing the UAVs in 3D space over the distributed ground-based mobile users. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose QoE analysis in cache-enabled multi-UAV networks (QMUN). It functions in three steps. First, it creates clusters for the ground-basedmobile users using the K-means algorithm and finds the optimized 2D positions of all the UAVs. Second, it finds the optimized heights of all UAVs before assigning them to the individual cluster. Finally, it infuses proactive content caching and optimizes the cache policy. Therefore, the delay associated with the content delivery is minimized, which leads to the generation of high value of CDI.

However, previous studies have rarely considered the process of landform change due to continuous simulation experiments of alternating tillage erosion and water erosion. To identify such changes, we applied a scouring experiment (at a 60 L min(-1) water discharge rate based on precipitation data from the local meteorological station and the catchment area in the Yuanmou County, Yunnan Province, China) and a series of simulated tillage experiments where plots were consecutively tilled 5, 10, and 15 times in rotation (representing 5 yr, 10 yr, and 15 yr of tillage) at slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees. Close-range photogrammetry (CRP) employing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) was used to measure landform changes, and high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) were generated to calculate net soil loss volumes. Additionally, the CRP was determined to be accurate and applicable through the use of erosion pins. The average tillage erosion rates were 69.85, 131.45, and 155.34 t center dot hm(-2)center dot tillage pass(-1), and the average water erosion rates were 1892.52, 2961.76, and 4405.93 t center dot hm(-2)center dot h(-1) for the 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees sloping farmland plots, respectively. The water erosion rates increased as tillage intensity increased, indicating that tillage erosion accelerates water erosion. Following these intensive tillage treatments, slope gradients gradually decreased, while the trend in slope gradients increased in runoff plots at the conclusion of the scouring experiment. Compared to the original plots (prior to our experiments), interactions between tillage and water erosion caused no obvious change in the landform structure of the runoff plots, while the height of all the runoff plots decreased.

Based on the vehicle's trajectory data extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos using an automated video analysis system, vehicles' collision risk is computed by extended time to collision (ITC). Then, two time-varying mixed logic models including time-varying random effects logistic regression (T-RELR) model and time-varying random parameters logistic regression (T-RPLR) are developed to examine the time varying effects of influencing factors on vehicle collision risk, and four models including the standard random effects logistic regression (SRELR) model, standard random parameters logistic regression (S-RPLR) model, distance-varying random effects logistic regression (D-RELR) model and distance-varying random parameters logistic regression (D-RPLR) are developed for model performance comparison. The results indicate that the T-RPLR model has the highest prediction accuracy. Eight influencing factors including following vehicle's travel distance, following vehicle's initial lane, following vehicle's toll collection type, leading vehicle's toll collection type, distance between two vehicles' centroids, and following vehicle's speed, are found to have time-varying effects on collision risk. Meanwhile, the first six factors are found to exhibit heterogeneous effects over the travel time. Another important finding is that the vehicle that comes from the innermost lane has an increasing trend to be involved in traffic conflicts, whereas the collision risks of other vehicles decrease as the travel time increases. Moreover, vehicles with higher speed have a decreasing probability to be involved in crashes over the travel time. Interestingly, the results of D-RPLR model are similar with that of T-RPLR model.

Recently launched satellites and conventional aerial platforms (such as commercial UAV and professional drones) have sensors leading to more detailed and rich data source for this purpose. From these, data most of the times come in the form of optical images and LiDAR measurements. Resolution of this acquired data has increased significantly such that most ground objects (as buildings, trees, ships, cars, airplanes) can be detected and analyzed in detail. Therefore, computer vision methods have become extremely useful in remote sensing applications such as building detection and shape extraction for urban planning; tree crown measurement for crop yield forecasting; ship detection for monitoring unlawful fishery; car detection for traffic flow monitoring and intelligent transportation; and airplane detection for military and commercial operations. Researchers proposed several methods to automate the mentioned applications since manually handling them is extremely hard and prohibitively time consuming. Unfortunately, the proposed methods focus on one object type most of the times. Therefore, there is no general method to handle all the mentioned applications using computer vision tools. To overcome this problem, we propose a general framework for object detection and shape extraction in remote sensing data. Our method is based on probabilistic representation inspired by our previous work and perceptual organization principles. Due to space limitations, we only focus on buildings, trees, ships, airplanes, and cars as objects of interest in this study. We test the proposed method on several optical images acquired by different satellites and LiDAR data obtained from an aerial platform.

Using the internationally comparable Frey-Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. Some of these professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. By 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia will need to adapt during the fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long-term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate and compensating effects of retraining, new jobs creation and other labour market adaptation mechanisms.

Due to the NP-hardness of the TSP whose computational complexity increases exponentially as an increment of number of nodes, heuristic algorithms, such as nearest neighbor heuristic TSP algorithm (NN), have been developed for reducing this data delivery latency in shortest possible time. In our previous research work we have published the directional NN algorithm directed to the next nearest node (DDNN) (Alemayehu and Kim in Wirel Pers Commun 95:3271-3285, 2017) which modifies the existing NN algorithm to gain a reduction in this data delivery latency.

In this paper, a framework for secure and reliable energy trading among UAVs and charging stations is presented. Advanced blockchain, based on the tangle data structure is used to create a distributed network of UAVs and charging stations. The proposed model allows the UAVs to buy energy from the charging station in exchange for tokens. If the UAV does not have sufficient tokens to buy the energy, then the model allows the UAV to borrow tokens from the charging station. The borrowed tokens can be repaid back to the charging station with interest or late fees. A game-theoretic model is used for deciding the buying strategy of energy for UAVs. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed model helps in providing increased utility for the swarm of UAVs and charging stations in a secure and cost-optimal way as compared to the conventional schemes. The results can eventually be applied to IoT devices that constantly need energy to perform under ideal conditions."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

To elucidate its structural and functional roles in Malpighian tubules, we used the c42-GAL4/UAS system to selectively knock down Tsp2A in principal cells of the tubule. Tsp2A localizes to smooth septate junctions (sSJ) in Malpighian tubules in a complex shared with partner proteins Snakeskin (Ssk), Mesh, and Discs large (Dlg). Knockdown of Tsp2A led to the intracellular retention of Tsp2A, Ssk, Mesh, and Dlg, gaps and widening spaces in remaining sSJ, and tumorous and cystic tubules. Elevated protein levels together with diminished V-type H+-ATPase activity in Tsp2A knockdown tubules are consistent with cell proliferation and reduced transport activity. Indeed, Malpighian tubules isolated from Tsp2A knockdown flies failed to secrete fluid in vitro. The absence of significant transepithelial voltages and resistances manifests an extremely leaky epithelium that allows secreted solutes and water to leak back to the peritubular side. The tubular failure to excrete fluid leads to extracellular volume expansion in the fly and to death within the first week of adult life. Expression of the c42-GAL4 driver begins in Malpighian tubules in the late embryo and progresses upstream to distal tubules in third instar larvae, which can explain why larvae survive Tsp2A knockdown and adults do not. Uncontrolled cell proliferation upon Tsp2A knockdown confirms the role of Tsp2A as tumor suppressor in addition to its role in sSJ structure and transepithelial transport."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Various opportunistic transmission models and corresponding application scenarios are introduced according to different flight modes of UAVs, including opportunistic data dissemination, collection, caching, computing, and forwarding. Two preliminary cases demonstrate that effective OUU models can improve network performance without relying on dedicated deployment of aerial communication platforms, and thus alleviate the aerial traffic congestion issue.

Due to the small size and the presence of only rotating parts, drones escape traditional controls and therefore represent a danger. This paper reports a methodology for identifying the presence of small UAVs inside a closed environment by measuring the noise emitted during the flight. Acoustic measurements of the noise emitted by a drone inside a large environment (12.0 x 30.0 x 12.0 m) were performed. The noise was measured with a sound level meter placed at different distances (5, 10, and 15 m), to characterize the noise in the absence of anthropic noise. In this configuration, a typical tonal component of drone noise is highlighted at the frequency of one-third of an octave at 5000 Hz due to the rotation of the blades. This component is also present 15 m away from the source point. Subsequent measurements were performed by introducing into the environment, through a loudspeaker, the anthropogenic noise produced by the buzz of people and background music. It is possible to distinguish the typical tonal component of UAV noise at the frequency of 5000 Hz even when the level of recording of anthropogenic noise emitted by the loudspeaker is at the maximum power tested. It is therefore possible to search for the presence of small UAVs inside a specific closed environment with only acoustic measurements, paying attention to the typical frequency of noise emission equal to 5000 Hz."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The aim of intelligent transportation system is to provide the On-Road Vehicles (ORVs) with reliable Internet access connectivity, emergency notification and other safety information via infrastructure-based Road Side Units (RSUs). In the past decade, intelligent transportation system has been started in many countries where RSUs are provided with all type of communication services to connect, compute, communicate and share the information between its neighboring RSUs and on-road vehicles. However, there are certain diffcuilties in which the information cannot be delivered reliably such as Line Of Sight (LOS) communication with on-road vehicles, packet loss, latency, retransmission overhead and multiple target tracking of objects over time-to-time etc. Thus, the intelligent transportation system becomes a complex network of entities. Modern intelligent transportation systems use relay-RSU nodes (i.e., small sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) also referred as RRSU node network deployed between satellites and on-road vehicles as they provide many advanages like coverage, reliability and information sharing without depending more on knowledge provided by satellites. In this paper, a novel Aerial Intelligent Relay-Road Side Unit (AIR-RSU) framework has been proposed to determine the network connectivity status level and analyze the communication link stability among RRSUs, and between RRSUs and on-road vehicles for every time instants T-i based on certain performance metrics discussed in this paper. The proposed AIR-RSU framework holds the precise status/information about the network connectivity needed in the transportation environment carefully and effectively accounting the frequent changes in positions. The performance of the proposed AIR-RSU framework is evaluated using rectangle waypoint mobility model for on-road vehicles and steady state random waypoint mobility model for RRSU nodes, which measures the network connectivity status and the performance metrics periodically.

In a few years, these applications will be fully integrated into our lives. The practical application and use of UAVs presents several problems that are of a different nature to the specific technology of the components involved. Among them, the most relevant problem deriving from the use of UAVs in logistics distribution tasks is the so-called \"last mile\" delivery. In the present work, we focus on the resolution of the truck-drone team logistics problem. The problems of tandem routing have a complex structure and have only been partially addressed in the scientific literature. The use of UAVs raises a series of restrictions and considerations that did not appear previously in routing problems; most notably, aspects such as the limited power-life of batteries used by the UAVs and the determination of rendezvous points where they are replaced by fully-charged new batteries. These difficulties have until now limited the mathematical formulation of truck-drone routing problems and their resolution to mainly small-size cases. To overcome these limitations we propose an iterated greedy heuristic based on the iterative process of destruction and reconstruction of solutions. This process is orchestrated by a global optimization scheme using a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. We test our approach in a large set of instances of different sizes taken from literature. The obtained results are quite promising, even for large-size scenarios."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The simulation results show that most areas of the downwash airflow tend to be stable within 4.5 s, and due to the downward flow characteristics after the stabilization, the z-direction (perpendicular to the ground) velocity of the downwash airflow directly under the rotor is the highest with a maximum value of -8.96 m/s, which accounts for the main part of the downwash flow. The rotor downwash airflow flows downward in spiral form and the phenomenon of \"contraction and expansion\" is obvious during the downwash flow.

The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach.

In order to be entirely applicable to various kinds of assignments; being portable and transportable, having a low-volume is vital which is one of the main challenges in the design of quadcopters. This necessity, brings up a new research topic, namely morphologic quadcopters that are unique due to their nature of self-arm management feature. As morphologic quadcopters have self-arm management, they are capable of autonomously fold and deploy their arms which increases their functionally significantly. In this paper, we will present a self-foldable and self-deployable autonomous quadcopter, named as Folly. Folly is deployable to autonomous systems effortlessly as it is close-packed, mobile and has a self-arm management. In the design of self-arm management, we utilized a four-bar crank-rocker mechanism that is actuated by a single servo motor and coupled with spur gears that allow Folly to automatically fold and deploy its arms in a short period time, 0.6 s. The crank-rocker mechanism employed is scrutinized for position, velocity and acceleration kinematics to establish an efficient design. In addition, torque characteristics of the mechanism are analyzed numerically and collated with dynamic simulation to ensure desirable power transmission rates. Moreover, as a new approach, to deal with vibration effects in morphologic quadcopters, the frame material of Folly is selected to be acrylic. Furthermore, Folly has two flight modes which are the hover flight mode for horizontal flight patterns, and the object-tracking mode that enables indoor usage by preventing collision and increasing functionality.

This work investigates the economic viability of integrating UAVs into urban hospital supply chains. In doing so, a strategic model that determines the optimal configuration of supporting infrastructure for urgent UAV delivery between hospitals is proposed. The model incorporates a tailored facility location algorithm that selects an optimal number of hubs given a set of candidates and determines the number of UAVs required to fulfill total demand. The objective is to minimize the total cost of implementation, computed as the sum of generalized, battery, vehicle, and hub establishment costs. The model is applied to a case study based on the establishment of a UAV delivery network for deliveries between National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in London. A baseline scenario is also developed using current NHS vehicles for delivery. Results demonstrate that UAV-based delivery provides significant reductions in operational costs compared with the baseline. Furthermore, the analysis indicates the location of hubs is more significant to the solution optimality than any increase in range or payload."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Blue whales employ an energetically demanding lunge feeding method that requires the whales to selectively feed where energetic gain exceeds energetic loss, while also balancing oxygen consumption, breath holding capacity, and surface recuperation time. Hence, blue whale foraging behavior is primarily driven by krill patch density and depth, but many studies have not fully considered surface feeding as a significant foraging strategy in energetic models. We collected predator and prey data on a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) foraging ground in New Zealand in February 2017 to assess the distributional and behavioral response of blue whales to the distribution and density of krill prey aggregations. Krill density across the study region was greater toward the surface (upper 20 m), and blue whales were encountered where prey was relatively shallow and more dense. This relationship was particularly evident where foraging and surface lunge feeding were observed. Furthermore, New Zealand blue whales also had relatively short dive times (2.83 +/- 0.27 SE min) as compared to other blue whale populations, which became even shorter at foraging sightings and where surface lunge feeding was observed. Using an unmanned aerial system (UAS; drone) we also captured unique video of a New Zealand blue whale's surface feeding behavior on well-illuminated krill patches. Video analysis illustrates the whale's potential use of vision to target prey, make foraging decisions, and orient body mechanics relative to prey patch characteristics. Kinematic analysis of a surface lunge feeding event revealed biomechanical coordination through speed, acceleration, head inclination, roll, and distance from krill patch to maximize prey engulfment. We compared these lunge kinematics to data previously reported from tagged blue whale lunges at depth to demonstrate strong similarities, and provide rare measurements of gape size, and krill response distance and time. These findings elucidate the predator-prey relationship between blue whales and krill, and provide support for the hypothesis that surface feeding by New Zealand blue whales is an important component to their foraging ecology used to optimize their energetic efficiency. Understanding how blue whales make foraging decisions presents logistical challenges, which may cause incomplete sampling and biased ecological knowledge if portions of their foraging behavior are undocumented. We conclude that surface foraging could be an important strategy for blue whales, and integration of UAS with tag-based studies may expand our understanding of their foraging ecology by examining surface feeding events in conjunction with behaviors at depth."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Quantum dots (QDs) offer potentially invaluable societal benefits such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging. In contrast, QDs may also pose risks to human health and the environment under certain conditions. Here, we demonstrated that a unique combination of nanocrystals core components (Ag-In-Zn-S) would eliminate the toxicity problem and increase their biomedical applications. The alloyed quaternary nanocrystals Ag-In-Zn-S (QD(green), Ag1.0In1.2Zn5.6S9.4; QD(red), Ag1.0In1.0Zn1.0S3.5) were used to transport new unsymmetrical bisacridine derivatives (UAs, C-2028 and C-2045) into lung H460 and colon HCT116 cancer cells for improving the cytotoxic and antitumor action of these compounds. UAs were coupled with QD through physical adsorption. The obtained results clearly indicate that the synthesized nanoconjugates exhibited higher cytotoxic activity than unbound compounds, especially toward lung H460 cancer cells. Importantly, unsymmetrical bisacridines noncovalently attached to QD strongly protect normal cells from the drug action. It is worth pointing out that QD(green) or QD(red) without UAs did not influence the growth of cancer and normal cells, which is consistent with in vivo results. In noncellular systems, at pH 5.5 and 4.0, which relates to the conditions of endosomes and lysosomes, the UAs were released from QD-UAs nanoconjugates. An increase of total lysosomes content was observed in H460 cells treated with QDs-UAs which can affect the release of the UAs from the conjugates. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses revealed that QD-UAs nanoconjugates enter H460 cells more efficiently than to HCT116 and normal cells, which may be the reason for their higher cytotoxicity against lung cancer. Summarizing, the noncovalent attachment of UAs to QDs increases the therapeutic efficiency of UAs by improving cytotoxicity toward lung H460 cancer cells and having protecting effects on normal cells."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

EC measurements provide reliable results under turbulent atmospheric conditions, but under calm and stable conditions - as they often occur at night - these measurements are known to misrepresent exchange fluxes. Nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) budgets can provide independent flux estimates under stable conditions, but their application so far has been limited by rather high cost and practical difficulties. Unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) equipped with trace gas analysers have the potential to make this method more accessible. We present the methodology and results of a proof-ofconcept study carried out during the ScaleX 2016 campaign. Successive vertical profiles of carbon dioxide dry-air mole fraction in the NBL were taken with a compact analyser carried by a UAS. We estimate an average carbon dioxide flux of 12 mu molm(-2) s(-1), which is plausible for nocturnal respiration in this region in summer.

Drone-imagery methods can observe larger extents to estimate indicators at landscape scales with higher confidence than traditional field sampling. They also have the potential to replace field methods in some instances and enable the development of indicators not measurable from the ground. Much research has already demonstrated that several quantitative rangeland indicators can be estimated from high-resolution imagery. Developing a suite of monitoring methods that are useful for supporting management decisions (e.g., repeatable, cost-effective, and validated against field methods) will require additional exploration to develop best practices for image acquisition and analytical workflows that can efficiently estimate multiple indicators. We embedded with a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field monitoring crew in Northern California, USA to compare field-measured and imagery-derived indicator values and to evaluate the logistics of using small UAS within the framework of an existing monitoring program. The unified workflow we developed to measure fractional cover, canopy gaps, and vegetation height was specific for the sagebrush steppe, an ecosystem that is common in other BLM managed lands. The correspondence between imagery and field methods yielded encouraging agreement while revealing systematic differences between the methods. Workflow best practices for producing repeatable rangeland indicators is likely to vary by vegetation composition and phenology. An online space dedicated to sharing imagery-based workflows could spur collaboration among researchers and quicken the pace of integrating drone-imagery data within adaptive management of rangelands.

Using geostatistical methodologies specifically developed for spatially non-stationary and spatially dependent random variables, we estimate temperature structure from six profiles reaching roughly 500 m in altitude A mean function is specified to account for the variation in temperature with altitude and the structure function is estimated from the residuals. A 2/3 scaling exponent is fitted to the resulting curves commensurate with the inertial subrange of turbulence. The resulting structure functions of residuals are able to resolve the inertial subrange on most profiles at a range of separation distances.

As observations are expensive and logistically challenging, it is important to evaluate the benefit that additional observations could bring to NWP. Atmospheric soundings applying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a large potential to supplement conventional radiosonde sounding observations. Here, we applied UAV and radiosonde sounding observations from an RV Polarstern cruise in the ice-covered Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013 to evaluate the impact of their assimilation in the Polar version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (Polar WRF) model. Our experiments revealed small to moderate impacts of radiosonde and UAV data assimilation. In any case, the assimilation of sounding data from both radiosondes and UAVs improved the analyses of air temperature, wind speed, and humidity at the observation site for most of the time. Further, the impact on the results of 5-day-long Polar WRF experiments was often felt over distances of at least 300 km from the observation site. All experiments succeeded in capturing the main features of the evolution of near-surface variables, but the effects of data assimilation varied between different cases. Due to the limited vertical extent of the UAV observations, the impact of their assimilation was limited to the lowermost 1-2-km layer, and assimilation of radiosonde data was more beneficial for modeled sea level pressure and near-surface wind speed."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The initial patch size of the RWT dye was 2,600 m(2) and spread to 62,000 m(2) about 138 minutes later. The RWT patches gradually moved southwestward from the point where they were first released, similar to the pattern of tidal current flowing southwest as the tides gradually decreased. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) image showed highest resolution in terms of spatial and time resolution, but the coverage area was the narrowest. In the case of satellite images, the coverage area was wide, but there were some limitations compared to other platforms in terms of operability due to the long cycle of revisiting. For Sentinel-3 OLCI and GOCI, the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were the highest, but small fluorescent dye detection was limited in terms of spatial resolution. In the case of hyperspectral sensor mounted on manned aircraft, the spectral resolution was the highest, but this was also somewhat limited in terms of operability. From this simulation approach, multi-platform integrated observation was able to confirm that time, space and spectral resolution could be significantly improved. In the future, if this study results are linked to coastal numerical models, it will be possible to predict the transport and diffusion of contaminants, and it is expected that it can contribute to improving model accuracy by using them as input and verification data of the numerical models."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Some sources are legacy, such as heavy metals accumulated in soils, and some are current, such as particulate matter. Because the global burden of disease from pollution is so high, it is important to identify legacy and current sources and to develop and implement effective techniques to reduce human exposure. But many limitations exist in our understanding of the distribution and transport processes of pollutants themselves, as well as the complicated overprint of human behavior and susceptibility. New approaches are being developed to identify and eliminate pollution in multiple environments. Community-scale detection of geogenic arsenic and fluoride in Bangladesh is helping to map the distribution of these harmful elements in drinking water. Biosensors such as bees and their honey are being used to measure heavy metal contamination in cities such as Vancouver and Sydney. Drone-based remote sensors are being used to map metal hot spots in soils from former mining regions in Zambia and Mozambique. The explosion of low-cost air monitors has allowed researchers to build dense air quality sensing networks to capture ephemeral and local releases of harmful materials, building on other developments in personal exposure sensing. And citizen science is helping communities without adequate resources measure their own environments and in this way gain agency in controlling local pollution exposure sources and/or alerting authorities to environmental hazards. The future of GeoHealth will depend on building on these developments and others to protect a growing population from multiple pollution exposure risks."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Mobile robot teams can play an important role in the automated execution of these tasks to reduce mission completion time. Planning strategies for such missions must take into account the formation of effective coalitions among available robots and assignment of tasks to robots with the goal of minimizing the expected mission completion time. The occurrence of unexpected situations that adversely interfere with the execution of the mission may require the execution of contingency tasks so that the originally planned tasks may proceed with minimal disruption. Initially reported potential contingency tasks may not always affect mission tasks due to the uncertainty in the mission environment. When potential contingency tasks are reported, the planner updates its existing plan to minimize the expected mission completion time based on the probability of these contingency tasks impacting the mission, their impact on the mission, and other task characteristics. We describe various heuristic-based strategies to compute task allocations for robots for mission execution. We perform simulation experiments to compare them and analyze the computational performance of the best performing strategy. We show that the proactive approach to contingency task management outperforms both the conservative and reactive approaches. Note to Practitioners-The work reported in this article will be useful for deploying multirobot teams to support complex logistics missions spread over a large area where the robots must be prepared to handle contingencies that can adversely impact the mission. The proposed proactive approach can be used to handle contingencies in information gathering, surveillance, guarding, and situational awareness tasks to support safe and secure transportation of important assets through crowded areas. We use port operation as an illustrative example where unmanned surface and aerial vehicles can be useful in ensuring the safety and security of the ports. This is a computationally challenging problem. This article proposes heuristic algorithms to solve the task allocation problem among many different agents efficiently.

A new process is presented for state estimation, trajectory planning, and dynamic control using a single onboard camera and inertia measurement unit (IMU). Specifically, a new nonlinear observer, which does not require localization information from external sensors (such as a motion capture system), is created for controlling the robot's velocity. The outer position-control loop is designed in terms of the invariant image feature which is decoupled from the robot's attitude and is proved to be the flat outputs of the system. The combined estimation and control scheme is shown to be asymptotically stable in the Lyapunov sense, where damping due to air contributes to stabilizing the rates of the swing angle. The optimal trajectory of the Euclidean homography is efficiently generated to obtain dynamically-feasible trajectories for the image features. A least-square identification technique is employed to estimate the mass of each payload, and the input shaping technique is implemented to reduce payload swing motion.

In this problem, our aim is to find a way to cover all areas with the necessary number of UAVs during the time windows, while minimizing the total distance traveled, and providing a fast solution by satisfying the additional constraint that each agent has limited fuel.

Mapping boulders in the field is time and labour-intensive, and work on intertidal reef platforms, as in the present study, is physically challenging. By addressing coastal scientists who are not specialists in remote sensing, this contribution reports on the possibilities and limitations of digital applications in boulder mapping in Eastern Samar, Philippines, where recent supertyphoons Haiyan and Hagupit induced high waves, coastal flooding and boulder transport. It is demonstrated how satellite imagery of sub-metre resolution (from Pleiades and WorldView-3 imagery) enables efficient analysis of transport vectors and distances of larger boulders, reflecting variation in latitudes of both typhoon tracks and approaching angles of typhoon-generated waves. During the investigated events, boulders with a-axes of up to 8 m were clearly identified to have been shifted for up to 32 m, mostly along the seaward margin of the boulder field. It is, however, hard to keep track of smaller boulders, and the length of a-axes and b-axes including their orientation is often impossible to map with sufficient accuracy. Orthophotographs and digital surface models created through the application of an unmanned aerial vehicle and the 'Structure from Motion' technique provide ultra-high-resolution data, and have the potential to not only improve the results of satellite image analysis, but also those from field mapping and may significantly reduce overall time in the field. Orthophotographs permit unequivocal mapping of a-axes and b-axes including their orientation, while precise values for c-axes can be derived from the respective digital surface models. Volume of boulders is best inferred from boulder-specific Structure from Motion-based three-dimensional models. Battery power, flight speed and altitude determine the limits of the area covered, while patches shielded by the boulders are difficult to resolve. For some tasks, field mapping remains mandatory and cannot be replaced by currently available remote sensing tools: for example, sampling for rock type, density and age dating, recording of lithological separation of boulders from the underlying geological unit and of geomorphic features on a millimetre to decimetre-scale, or documentation of fine-grained sediment transport in between the boulders in supratidal settings. In terms of future events, the digital products presented here will provide a valuable reference to track boulder transport on a centimetre to decimetre-scale and to better understand the hydrodynamics of extreme-wave events on a fringing reef coastline."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

These high-energy impacts, caused by severe storms or tsunamis, can trigger initial cracking and transport of boulders. Monitoring of these boulders, as well as the associated coastal sites is important in distinguishing between gradual coastal processes and high-energy events. Western Greece is a seismically active area, where tsunamis and high-energetic storms might occur and such past events are documented by historic and geoscientific research, making it an ideal location for monitoring dislocated boulders. Since 2008, monitoring of eight different coastal sites in this region was conducted by terrestrial laser scanning and photogrammetric approaches, with low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles. The re-use of similar surveying points in following years, allowed highly accurate monitoring. Point clouds derived from these methods were evaluated for change detection by point cloud comparisons. The data were also used to establish accurate three-dimensional models of dislocated boulders (n = 70). The determined boulder volumes of these accurate three-dimensional models were incorporated in wave transport equations and wave decay curves, and compared with monitoring results. A comprehensive overview of dislocated boulders in western Greece is presented. Three-dimensional boulder reconstruction is compared to an approach which uses a tape-based measuring of boulder axes, with the tape-based measurement showing a mean overestimation of mass by 32%. Accurate monitoring over time by both methods, is achieved by using fixed networks of reference points. Changes for each site over time, detected by direct point cloud comparisons, are fit to the possible inundation calculated by wave decay curves based on computed minimum wave heights for boulder transport. Both storm and tsunami waves may have initiated movement from the cliff edge and further transport is also possible. However, boulders showed no further movement from their current position in the area for the time period of this study."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Methods This was a retrospective study of women with a monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy who underwent laser surgery for TTTS between January 2012 and May 2018 at a single institution. Absolute intertwin difference in UA pulsatility index (DUAPI) was measured within 48 h prior to laser surgery. Twins with intermittent or persistent absent/reversed end-diastolic flow (EDF) in the UA (UA-EDF) were analyzed separately. Survival of both or at least one infant at birth and at 30 days postpartum was compared between pregnancies with an intertwin DUAPI of >= 0.4 and those with an intertwin DUAPI of < 0.4, as well as between fetuses with intermittent and those with persistent absent/reversed UA-EDF. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used for analysis. Regression analysis was performed to determine if intertwin DUAPI and intermittent or persistent absent/reversed UA-EDF were associated independently with infant survival, while controlling for gestational age at delivery, Quintero stage and other important confounding variables. Results Of 231 TTTS pregnancies that underwent laser surgery during the study period, UA Doppler information could be retrieved for 206 and delivery information was available for 184, which comprised the study population. Rates of double-twin survival at birth were significantly higher in pregnancies with an intertwin DUAPI of < 0.4 than in those with an intertwin DUAPI of >= 0.4 (83.9% (78/93) vs 50.0% (12/24); P< 0.001). Double-infant survival at birth was higher in pregnancies with intermittent compared to those with persistent absent/reversed UA-EDF (73.0% (27/37) vs 36.7% (11/30); P= 0.003). Regression analysis demonstrated that an intertwin DUAPI of < 0.4 was associated with increased survival of both twins at delivery (P< 0.001) and at 30 days postpartum (P= 0.002), as well as increased survival of at least one twin at delivery (P= 0.009). Similarly, intermittent absent/reversed UA-EDF was associated with increased survival of both twins at delivery (P= 0.007) and at 30 days after birth (P= 0.015). Conclusions Evaluation of intertwin differences in UA impedance to blood flow as well as identification of intermittent or persistent absent or reversed UA-EDF prior to laser surgery could help in the prediction of double-infant survival at birth and to 30 days in twin pregnancies with TTTS.

Twelve- and 11-day measurements were conducted during February and March 2018, respectively. In total, 46 flights were conducted between 05:00 and 06:00 AM Local Time (LT). The average concentrations of PM2.5 and BC were significantly lower in March (40.1 +/- 17.9 and 2.3 +/- 2.0 mu g m(-3), respectively) when easterly winds prevailed, compared with those in February (69.8 +/- 35.7 and 3.6 +/- 2.0 mu g m(-3), respectively) when northerly winds dominated. In general, PM2.5 concentrations decreased with height, with a vertical decrement of 0.2 mu g m(-3) per 10 m. BC concentrations exhibited diverse vertical profiles with an overall vertical decrement of 0.1 mu g m(-3) per 10 m. Meteorological analyses including back-trajectory analysis and atmospheric stability categorization revealed that both advection and convection transports may have notable influences on the vertical profiles of PM pollutants. The concentration of PM pollutants above the boundary layer was lower than that within the layer, thus exhibiting a sigmoid profile in some cases. In addition, the lighting of firecrackers and fireworks on February 16 (first day of the Chinese New Year) resulted in the elevated concentrations of PM2.5 and BC within 150 m AGL. The takeoff of a civil flight on February 10 may have resulted in a substantial increase in the PM2.5 concentrations from 80.8 (+/- 2.1) mu g m(-3) at the ground level to 119.2 (+/- 9.3) mu g m(-3) at a height of 330 m.

Mapping coastal areas within the Delaware Bay is particularly difficult due to inherent environmental factors such as low underwater visibility (less than 1 m), rapid tidal current (greater than 1 m/s), changeable weather, and strong mid-latitude winds. This study utilized four sonar systems, two manned vessels, two autonomous vessels, three real-time kinematics global positioning systems (RTK GPS), two unmanned autonomous aerial systems, and satellite imagery to quantify subaerial and subaqueous volume and feature changes following storm events. The study site was located at Broadkill Beach, Delaware, a microtidal beach inside the Delaware estuary and outside the National Coastal Mapping Program survey area. Six storms (four tropical and two extratropical cyclones) from 2012 to 2018 were surveyed pre- and post-storm. Key insights in sensors and platforms proved unmanned aerial systems (UAS) orthomosaic resolution to be superior for mapping shoreline, profile, and dune toe changes, swash zone features such as cusps, wrack lines, and infrastructure damage to beach crossovers. Subaqueous platforms performed well for most storm events with RMSE of 0.23 m or less. This uncertainty, including subaerial uncertainty (max = 0.016 m), can be reduced with precise GPS systems and ground truthing of elevations through additional sensors like RTK GPS and subbottom profilers. No clear pattern emerged between accretion and erosion for tropical or extratropical cyclones (TC or ETC). Low-energy beaches are rarely studied and therefore open-coast relationships are transplanted to these environments. Storm responses of the site did not match expected traditional cross-shore transport models as beach orientation and storm wind direction most likely induced longshore transport out of the system. UAS orthomosaics were critical in identifying wrack lines and debris which altered subaerial transport patterns at this low-energy site. This work highlights the importance of irregular, small-scale features such as relic jetties, wrack lines, and local wind waves in estuarine sites when traditional open-coast theory would diminish these processes. More importance should be placed on the use of high-resolution imagery and elevation data over widely spaced profiles when monitoring and managing low-energy sites experiencing episodic storms such as TC and ETC to accurately assess processes, relationships, and morphologic response."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The cost of the support of such unmanned aerial vehicle could be significantly lower than in case of medical helicopter, which is not necessary in some cases. Designed unmanned aerial vehicle can also be used for fast delivery of essential medical substances (e.g. blood). The selection of configuration was the first and crucial step of the design. After analysis of many different copter configurations, together with selected crash reports analysis, the coaxial quadcopter configuration crossed with conventional airplane was selected. All power units for VTOL capability are electric, and they are doubled for redundancy purposes, with maximum T/W ratio about 2.0. Such configuration allows to sustain a stable flight (vertical phases) in case of one motor failure. Two versions of the vehicle are designed: fully electric (power units for the forward flight and vertical takeoff and landing are electric) and mixed where forward flight unit is a small piston engine. The final layout was the result of conceptual investigation and preliminary research, MDO and trade-off analysis, where as many aspects as possible were considered.

Different merging decisions are made due to drivers' various perception abilities of potential danger, which might significantly increase the crash risk. Driving assistance technology (DA) is expected to be an effective way of mitigating the crash risk. Hence, this paper aims to contribute to the literature by designing a model strategy to predict the crash risk of merging drivers in order to enhance the merging assistance system for crash avoidance. Methods: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collect individual vehicle data to conduct traffic analysis at the microscopic level. A model strategy was proposed to predict the crash risk of merging vehicles which could make sure that ramp drivers are aware of potential risks in advance. Three models (i.e., binary logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and nested logit models) were developed and compared. Results: Target-lane-related and merging-vehicle-related variables were found significant with crash risk, including the speed of the merging vehicle, the speed of lead/lag vehicle in the target lane, the type of lead/lag vehicle in the target lane. Different variables were found to be significant in the proposed models. Conclusions: The results suggest that the nested logit model has the highest prediction accuracy. It is concluded that the merging speed, driving ability (i.e., lane-keeping instability), and the vehicle type in the target lane affect the crash risk. Finally, the implementation of the proposed prediction model for merging assistance system is designed. The findings from this study can have implications for the design of the merging assistance system for helping drivers make safe merging decisions and thus enhancing the safety of the interchange merging area."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The moraines are characterized by striking sawtooth or hairpin planforms, which are locally superimposed, giving rise to a complex spatial pattern. We recognize two distinct populations of moraines, namely a group of relatively prominent moraine ridges (mean height similar to 1.2 m) and a group of comparatively low-relief moraines (mean height similar to 0.4 m). These two groups often occur in sets/systems, comprising one pronounced outer ridge and several inset smaller moraines. Using a representative subsample of the moraines, we establish that they form by either (i) submarginal deformation and squeezing of subglacial till or (ii) pushing of extruded tills. Locally, proglacial (glaciofluvial) sediments are also incorporated within the moraines during pushing. For the first time, to our knowledge, we demonstrate categorically that these moraines formed sub-annually using repeat uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. We present a conceptual model for sub-annual moraine formation at Fjallsjokull that proposes the sawtooth moraine sequence comprises (i) sets of small squeeze moraines formed during melt-driven squeeze events and (ii) larger push moraines formed during winter re-advances. We suggest the development of this process-form regime is linked to a combination of elevated temperatures, high surface meltwater fluxes to the bed and emerging basal topography (a depositional overdeepening). These factors result in highly saturated subglacial sediments and high porewater pressures, which induces submarginal deformation and ice-marginal squeezing during the melt season. Strong glacier recession during the summer, driven by elevated temperatures, allows several squeeze moraines to be emplaced. This process-form regime may be characteristic of active temperate glaciers receding into overdeepenings during phases of elevated temperatures, especially where their englacial drainage systems allow efficient transfer of surface meltwater to the glacier bed near the snout margin.

However, little is known about the motivational factors influencing these intentions. This paper explores medical students' intentions to practise in UAs and the motivational factors predicting these intentions. Methods Eligible participants included graduating medical students from four of the five Swiss medical schools, who self-reported specialty choice, intentions to practise in UAs, and motives that explained their career choices. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare site, gender, specialty choice and UA practice intention. Motives were aggregated to obtain motivational factors using a principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Logistic regression was used to predict the effects of these motivational factors and of gender on UA practice intention. Results Of 1749 students included in the study, 240 (13.7%) expressed an intention to practise in UAs (62.1% of whom intended to practise in rural areas) and 719 (41.1%) were undecided. In those who wished to practise in UAs, general practice (21.6%) was the most preferred specialty. Motivational factors influencing specialty choice were intellectual challenge, work variety, work conditions and enthusiasm (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index 0.79, P < .001, 49.0% of variance explained). Students motivated by work variety (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.7) and by work conditions (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6) were more likely to choose UAs and those motivated by intellectual challenge (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.5) were less likely. Undecided students' motivations were very similar to those of students interested in working in UAs. Conclusions The actual number of Swiss students interested in working in UAs is low and is probably insufficient to meet current societal needs. Work variety and work conditions appear to be factors that might attract interested and undecided students towards working in UAs."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

A machine learning-based DOA measurement method is proposed to make a substantial secrecy rate (SR) performance gain compared to single-snapshot measurement without machine learning for a given null-space projection beamforming scheme. However, for a conventional DM network, there still exists a serious security issue: the eavesdropper moves inside the main beam of the desired user and may intercept the CMs intended for the desired users because the BVCM and ANPM are only angle-dependent.

The aim of the present study was to verify the reliability of RS techniques for the estimation of pruning biomass through differences in the volume of canopy trees and to evaluate the performance of an unsupervised segmentation methodology as a feasible tool for the analysis of large areas. Remote sensed data were acquired on four uneven-aged and irregularly spaced chestnut orchards in Central Italy by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a multispectral camera. Chestnut geometric features were extracted using both supervised and unsupervised crown segmentation and then applying a double filtering process based on Canopy Height Model (CHM) and vegetation index threshold. The results show that UAV monitoring provides good performance in detecting biomass reduction after pruning, despite some differences between the trees' geometric features. The proposed unsupervised methodology for tree detection and vegetation cover evaluation purposes showed good performance, with a low undetected tree percentage value (1.7%). Comparing crown projected volume reduction extracted by means of supervised and unsupervised approach, R-2 ranged from 0.76 to 0.95 among all the sites. Finally, the validation step was assessed by evaluating correlations between measured and estimated pruning wood biomass (Wpw) for single and grouped sites (0.53 < R-2 < 0.83).

One of the core challenges in exploitation of such high temporal data streams, specifically videos, is the trade-off between the quality of video streaming and limited transmission bandwidth.

This coherent nature of the video frames dictates a high probability of a macroblock having the same direction of motion as the macroblocks surrounding it. The technique employs the partial distortion elimination algorithm to condense the exploration time, where partial summation of the matching distortion between the current macroblock and its contender ones will be used, when the matching distortion surpasses the current lowest error.

A comparison of the refraction corrected LiDAR point cloud with independent underwater checkpoints exhibited a maximum deviation of 7.8 cm and revealed a systematic depth-dependent error when using a refraction coefficient of n = 1.36 for time-of-flight correction. The bias is attributed to multi-path effects in the turbid water column (Secchi depth: 1.1 m) caused by forward scattering of the laser signal at suspended particles. Due to the high spatial resolution, good depth performance, and accuracy, the sensor shows a high potential for applications in hydrology, fluvial morphology, and hydraulic engineering, including flood simulation, sediment transport modeling, and habitat mapping."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Timely monitoring of Fusarium wilt disease is important for the disease treatment and adjustment of banana planting methods. The objective of this study was to establish a method for identifying the banana regions infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt disease using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral imagery. Two experiments were conducted in this study. In experiment 1, 120 sample plots were surveyed, of which 75% were used as modeling dataset for model fitting and the remaining were used as validation dataset 1 (VD1) for validation. In experiment 2, 35 sample plots were surveyed, which were used as validation dataset 2 (VD2) for model validation. An UAV equipped with a five band multispectral camera was used to capture the multispectral imagery. Eight vegetation indices (VIs) related to pigment absorption and plant growth changes were chosen for determining the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the plants. The binary logistic regression (BLR) method was used to assess the spatial relationships between the VIs and the plants infested or not infested with Fusarium wilt. The results showed that the banana Fusarium wilt disease can be easily identified using the VIs including the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen), red-edge chlorophyll index (CIRE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE). The fitting overall accuracies of the models were greater than 80%. Among the investigated VIs, the CIRE exhibited the best performance both for the VD1 (OA = 91.7%, Kappa = 0.83) and VD2 (OA = 80.0%, Kappa = 0.59). For the same type of VI, the VIs including a red-edge band obtained a better performance than that excluding a red-edge band. A simulation of imagery with different spatial resolutions (i.e., 0.5-m, 1-m, 2-m, 5-m, and 10-m resolutions) showed that good identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt was obtained when the resolution was higher than 2 m. As the resolution decreased, the identification accuracy of Fusarium wilt showed a decreasing trend. The findings indicate that UAV-based remote sensing with a red-edge band is suitable for identifying banana Fusarium wilt disease. The results of this study provide guidance for detecting the disease and crop planting adjustment."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Due to application specific nature of wireless sensor networks, it is challenging to design a congestion control protocol that is suitable for all types of applications in the Internet of Drones (IoD). Congestion avoidance and control in wireless sensor networks mainly aims at reducing packet drop due to congestion and maintaining fair bandwidth allocation to all network flows. In this research work, we propose a reliable and congestion based protocol, which provides both bidirectional reliability and rate adjustment based congestion control. It uses Technique for Order Preference by Similarly to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to select optimal path for data transmission because TOPSIS selects an alternative such that it has shortest distance from the ideal one and greatest distance from negative ideal solution. Congestion is detected by using proportion of average packet service time over average packet inter-arrival time as congestion degree. Then, congestion is notified using implicit notification to save energy and reduce overhead. To mitigate congestion along with maintaining fairness, an equal priority index is assigned to all data sources and when congestion occurs, rate adjustment to optimal value based on priority value is used for congestion control. This approach helps to diminish packet drops, maintain fairness and get better energy efficiency. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed protocol with that of existing protocols. Our simulation results show reduced average delivery overhead, drop packet ratio, queue length and delay with increased average delivery ratio. Moreover, our protocol provides better energy efficiency and fairness when compared with the existing competing protocols."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

We devise the scheduling and resource management that jointly solve the problem of optimizing the UAVs' locations and resource management, in order to maximize the network energy efficiency (EE).

We transform the coordinated optimization problem into a convex form, and adopt the noncooperative game theory to model the uncoordinated formulation.

The self-awareness is envisioned to improve the dynamic behavior of multirotors. The formation scheme that is implemented is called platooning, which arranges vehicles in a string behind the lead vehicle and is proposed to bring order into chaotic air space.

The airborne collision safety between the windshield of transport aircraft and the five light unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) under various possible flight conditions is mainly studied in this paper. The collision simulation model of drone and aircraft windshield is established under PAM-CRASH software environment, which is used to simulate the dynamic response and damage of the windshield after the impact of drone and aircraft windshield under various conditions. The simulation results with that of collision test between whole-level drones and a full-scale aircraft with windshield is compared and analyzed to verify the validity of the simulation. The drone with similar bird mass is also selected to verify the appropriateness of the airworthiness rules of the windshield structure against bird impact to light UAV. The influencing parameters are important to the research results and are taken into a little consideration in the study. The research shows that the configuration, material, weight, speed and attitude of drones all have significant effects on the impact damage to the aircraft windshield, and a \"parallel\" attitude of a 1360 g drone which was proven to be a very severe gesture resulted in an unairworthy consequence at an impact velocity of 154.8 mks. The windshield damage from a 1360 g drone strike is much heavier than that from a bird of a little big mass. It is expected that the high fidelity simulation model can be used to simulate all kinds of working conditions, reduce the test times, and save a lot of economic costs and provide credible technical support and basis for the airworthiness authorities to formulate precise and convincing regulatory regulations in future.

However, with the traditional 3-degree of freedom (DOF) model used in trajectory optimization, the realizability of the optimized trajectory is largely reduced without consideration of its dynamic constraints. Moreover, the landing and tracking precision of the system will also be reduced. To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel trajectory optimization method is explored. Different from existing research, trajectory optimization is achieved with a complete 6-DOF dynamic model of the parafoil delivery system. When this is combined with the Gauss pseudospectral method, complicated dynamic constraints can be taken into account in the trajectory optimization. In addition to achieving a global optimal control objective under dynamic constraints, the proposed method also can include multiple external environment constraints, such as terrain, wind disturbance and flared landing. Finally, our results show that the proposed method can achieve all the control objectives successfully. The optimized trajectory is smooth and realizable. Compared with other trajectory optimization methods that use a 3-DOF model, the advantage of the proposed method is clear. Considering the complicated dynamic constrains of the system, it has much better realizability and is more consistent with reality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The amount of payload affects the battery consumption rate (BCR), which can cause a disruption in delivery of goods if the BCR was under-estimated in the planning stage or cause unnecessarily higher expenses if it was over-estimated. Hence, a reliable parcel delivery schedule using drones is proposed to consider the BCR as a function of payload in the operational planning optimization. A minimum set covering approach is used to model the strategic planning and a mixed integer linear programming problem (MILP) is used for operational planning. A variable preprocessing algorithm and primal and dual bound generation methods are developed to improve the computational time for solving the operational planning model. The optimal solution provides the least number of drones and their flight paths to deliver parcels while ensuring the safe return of the drones with respect to the battery charge level.

The former reserve is the first Chinese national nature reserve for mangroves and the latter has the most abundant mangrove species in China. However, to date the aboveground ground biomass (AGB) of this mangrove region has not been quantified due to the high species diversity and the difficulty of extensive field sampling in mangrove habitat. Although three-dimensional point clouds can capture the forest vertical structure, their application to large areas is hindered by the logistics, costs and data volumes involved. To fill the gap and address this issue, this study proposed a novel upscaling method for mangrove AGB estimation using field plots, UAV-LiDAR strip data and Sentinel-2 imagery (named G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 model) based on a point-line-polygon framework. In this model, the partial-coverage UAV-LiDAR data were used as a linear bridge to link ground measurements to the wall-to-wall coverage Sentinel-2 data. The results showed that northeast Hainan Island has a total mangrove AGB of 312,806.29 Mg with a mean AGB of 119.26 Mg ha(-1). The results also indicated that at the regional scale, the proposed UAV-LiDAR linear bridge method (i.e., G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 model) performed better than the traditional approach, which directly relates field plots to Sentinel-2 data (named the G similar to S2 model) (R-2 = 0.62 > 0.52, RMSE = 50.36 Mg ha(-1) < 56.63 Mg ha(-1)). Through a trend extrapolation method, this study inferred that the G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 model could decrease the number of field samples required by approximately 37% in comparison with those required by the G similar to 52 model in the study area. Regarding the UAV-LiDAR sampling intensity, compared with the original number of LiDAR plots, 20% of original linear bridges could produce an acceptable accuracy (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 51.03 Mg ha(-1)). Consequently, this study presents the first investigation of AGE for the mangrove forests on northeast Hainan Island in China and verifies the feasibility of using this mangrove AGB upscaling method for diverse mangrove forests."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Here, we report an extensive two-month field campaign in an Alpine braided reach (La Severaisse river, French Alps) that experienced predictable daily peak discharge (48 events observed) generating significant bedload transport and morphological changes during the melting season. We monitored these processes using a wide range of direct and indirect techniques (bedload sampling, continuous seismic measurements, pebbles tracking, topographic surveys, remote sensing using ground control cameras and drone flights). Doing so, surrogate measurements allowed to extend temporally discrete manual bedload sampling, and to extend spatially local riverbed cross section measurements. These measurements provide unique complementary constraints on the targeted physics, at various spatial and temporal scales which enabled us to draw robust conclusions. Data showed a progressive decrease in bedload transport for a given flow rate along the two months period. Simultaneously, river morphology in the braided sections changed from an incised to a more distributed configuration which led to a decrease of local maxima in dimensionless shear stresses in the braided reach for similar flow conditions. This control of bedload transport by maximum local shear stresses was in line with tracked pebble surveys indicating that coarse bedload particles were mostly transported in the main active channel. At the reach scale, this transport was found to be more efficient in laterally confined sections than in braided ones which has important implications in terms of bedload estimation in alternative confined and braided (unconfined) rivers. Finally, this study highlight the interest to combine a large variety of traditional and innovative measurements techniques to better understand complex sediment transport processes in the field.

One of the emerging classes of technology in recent age dominate the universe of IoT is the concept of the Internet of Drones Thing (IoDT). The following work fundamentally emphasizes the key concepts of the Internet of Drones architecture in the context of the Edge computing perspective. A state of the art \"EdgeDrone\" concept has been engineered where the standard message transfer strategy of IoT and the opportunistic Ad-Hoc network have been amalgamated. Parameters like message transfer latency, overhead ratio, message delivery chances under several QoS values and resource usage, energy performance for the protocol have been analyzed. A hardware testbed has been implemented with the JavaScript platform along with the simulation which has been executed after tuning the performance of the protocols. The result shows 30% improvement in average packet delivery for enhanced MQTT-SN and about 17% improvement for enhanced MQTT in comparing to standard strategy. The study also reveals the minimum value of the message delivery latency of 15.5 msec for enhanced MQTT-SN in QoS-1. In memory usage point of view, the result shows that the MQTT broker takes a maximum of 5.6 MB of memory during enhanced MQTT-SN takes to publish subscribe operation which is significantly less. Another two major parameters which report the maximum message transfer bandwidth of 620 msg/sec for enhanced MQTT-SN at QoS 1 and about 1800 msg/sec for QoS 0 as well as the enhanced MQTT-SN within 802.15.4 interface ensures minimum energy consumption amongst all other strategies."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Despite their widespread adoption in the scientific community, they typically have low efficiency when deployed in river systems with active bedload transport or deep wet channels, attributed to their technical specifications. A recent evaluation of active ultra-high frequency transponders (a-UHF tags) assessed their larger detection range and provided a methodology for their geopositioning. In this study, we test five different survey methods (one including an unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV]) in a sediment tracking study, and compare them in terms of recovery rate, field effort, geopositioning error, and efficiency. We then tested the method on a larger reach following a Q(5) flood and performed cross-comparisons between active and passive RFIDs. The results confirmed that the a-UHF RFID technology allowed rapid (1.5 h ha(-1)) survey of a large area (<34 ha) of emerged bars and shallow water channels with recovery of a high percentage of tracers (72%) that had travelled large distances (mean approximate to 1000 m; max approximate to 3400 m). Moreover, the tracers were identified with low geopositioning error (mean approximate to 7.1 m, <= 1% of their travel distance). We also showed that a UAV-based survey was fast (0.38 h ha(-1)), efficient (recovery rate = 84%), and low error (mean approximate to 4.2 m). Thus, a-UHF RFID technology permits the development of a variety of survey methods, depending on the study objectives and the human and financial resources available. This allows field efforts to be optimized by determining an appropriate balance between the high equipment cost of a-UHF tracers and the resulting reduced survey costs.

Among other medical emergencies, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the most time-sensitive event that requires the quick provision of medical treatment including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and electric shocks by automated external defibrillators (AED). An emerging technology called unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) is regarded to support mountain rescuers in overcoming the time criticality of these emergencies by reducing the time span between SCA and early defibrillation. A drone that is equipped with a portable AED can fly from a base station to the patient's site where a bystander receives it and starts treatment. This paper considers such a response system and proposes an integer linear program to determine the optimal allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region. In detail, the developed model follows the objectives to minimize the number of used drones and to minimize the average travel times of defibrillator drones responding to SCA patients. In an example of application, under consideration of historical helicopter response times, the authors test the developed model and demonstrate the capability of drones to speed up the delivery of AEDs to SCA patients. Results indicate that time spans between SCA and early defibrillation can be reduced by the optimal allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region, thus increasing the survival rate of SCA patients."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Especially, UAVs are currently used not only in military fields but also in various private sectors such as IT, agriculture, logistics, construction, etc. The range is further expected to increase. Drone-related techniques need to evolve along with this change. In particular, there is a need for the development of an autonomous system in which a drone can determine and accomplish its mission even in the absence of remote control from a GCS (Ground Control Station). Responding to such requirements, there have been various studies and algorithms developed for autonomous flight systems. Especially, many ML-based (Machine-Learning-based) methods have been proposed for autonomous path finding. Unlike other studies, the proposed mechanism could enable autonomous drone path finding over a large target area without size limitations, one of the challenges of ML-based autonomous flight or driving in the real world. Specifically, we devised Multi-Layer HVIN (Hierarchical VIN) methods that increase the area applicable to autonomous flight by overlaying multiple layers. To further improve this, we developed Fisheye HVIN, which applied an adaptive map compression ratio according to the drone's location. We also built an autonomous flight training and verification platform.

Despite being often stable over a period ranging from several years to 50-60 years, the abundance of dead-ice makes them potentially unstable in the future. This study aims to: (1) recognize the different processes that contribute to ice-cored moraine degradation; (2) document the spatial distribution of mass wasting sites within ice-cored moraine complexes of Ebbabreen and Ragnarbreen, Svalbard; (3) investigate the relationship between the distribution of mass-movement sites and the topographic properties of the landscape; (4) develop a model of mass-wasting mechanism in a proglacial area. We performed field-based geomorphological mapping combined with the interpretation of aerial photographs (1960, 1990, 2009), high-resolution satellite imagery (2013). UAV-based images (2014), terrestrial photographs (2011-2014), hillshade models and digital elevation models. In 2013, frontal and lateral ice-cored landforms occupied 3.33 km(2) of the forelands of Ebbabreen and Ragnarbreen. The total area with an unstable ice-cored moraine condition was 0.57 km(2) (127 sites). Debris falls, slides, rolls and flows were the most important processes contributing to the reworking of glacigenic sediments and altering of their properties. Four different morphological site types were identified: (1) near vertical ice-cliffs covered with debris, transformed mainly by dead-ice backwasting as well as debris falls and slides, (2) steep debris slopes with exposed ice-cores dominated by debris slides, (3) gentle sediment-mantled slopes transformed by debris flows, and (4) non-active debris-mantled areas transformed by dead-ice downwasting alone. The spatial and temporal activation of moraines' reworking was for the most part related to local geomorphic conditions (e.g., slope gradient, occurrence of streams, and meltwater channels). Gravitational mass-movements were responsible for the redistribution of debris within the moraine-complex, whereas fluvial transport by meltwater exported sediments outside the Little Ice Age moraines.

We surveyed boulder arrangements occurring in the Atacama Desert and identified three accumulation types for further investigation: a small circular boulder cluster (BC), a long channelized boulder stream (BS), and a wide convex-shaped boulder field (BF). Drone-based photogrammetric techniques and field observations were used to generate high-quality digital elevation models and orthophotos to determine boulder count, size, coverage, orientation, lithology and local topography. Our data shows that the arrangement of boulder accumulations corresponds with the shape of the accommodation space and the boulder input, where BCs occur at the center of completely confined topographic depressions, BSs occur along laterally confined and incised hill slopes with boulders stacked above each other, and BFs occur on largely unconfined shallow and low-relief slopes with a distinct boulder front. A general downslope increase of average boulder size and coverage was measured in all boulder accumulations and a long-axis orientation of boulders parallel to the transport direction was observed for the BS. Based on these results and the lack of fluvial transport indicators, we conclude that transport and arrangement of boulder accumulations are largely controlled by the interplay of topography and seismic-driven boulder transport, resulting in unique landscape features present in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert. Such sedimentary transport processes are rare on Earth but potentially play a greater role on other arid planetary surfaces that are covered by boulders and subject to sufficient seismic activity.

In addition, grain sizes are analyzed to investigate the overall distribution pattern of gravels on the beach, and the beach topography is surveyed periodically to confirm the recovery rate of the beach. Grain-size analysis reveals that mean gravel sizes, in general, become finer from -6.2 Phi to -5.4 Phi towards the east in the seashore line direction. Variation in mean sizes is obviously observed in the cross-shore direction. Gravels in the swash zone are relatively fine about -4.5 Phi in size and equant in shape, whereas the coarse and oblate gravels ranged from -5 Phi to -6 Phi are found in the berm. Gamji gravel beach particularly has two lines of berms: a lower berm situated facing beach and an upper berm about 10 m landward. After the typhoon Kong-rey passed by, about 1.4 m of severe erosion in upper berm occurred, and the berm eventually disappeared. On the backshore of the upper berm about 50 cm of erosion took place so that the elevation became lower. However, tangible erosion was not observed in the lower berm. When typhoon Danas hit, rated as mild storm, both upper and lower berm were eroded out. However, about 50 cm of deposition occurred only in the backshore. Only three days later, the new lower berm was formed, meaning that sedimentation rate must be high. This result indicates that Gamji gravel beach is recovered very fast from erosion caused by the typhoons when it is under the fair-weather condition even though beach morphology changes dramatically in a short period of time.

The monitoring locations are at suburban elevated highway and transportation interchanges. The monitoring parameters include the particle number concentration (PN), particle mass concentration (PM), and black carbon (BC). The vertical profiles showed that most air pollutants increased significantly with the height of the elevated highways. Compared with the ground level, PNs increased by 54%-248% and BC increased by 201%. The decline rate of particle concentrations decreased with the increase of height and remained stable after 120 m. Furthermore, the R-2 heatmap for regressions between each altitude showed that the linear relationship between 0-120 m was higher than that of other altitudes. In horizontal profiles, PNs spread to 100 m and then began to decline, BC began to decay rapidly after 50 m, but PMs varied less. After crossing another highway, PNs increased by 69-289%, PMs by 7-28%, and BC by 101%. Furthermore, the formation of new particles was observed at both locations as PN3 increased with distance within 100 m from the highway.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the depletion of the Nup62 complex, constructing the nuclear pore channel in premeiotic Drosophila cells, resulted in the absence of meiotic cells. We attempted to understand the mechanism underlying the cell cycle arrest before meiosis. Methods: We induced dsRNAs against the nucleoporin mRNAs using the Gal4/UAS system in Drosophila. Results: The cell cycle of the Nup62-depleted cells was arrested before meiosis without CDK1 activation. The ectopic over-expression of CycB, but not constitutively active CDK1, resulted in partial rescue from the arrest. CycB continued to exist in the nuclei of Nup62-depleted cells and cells depleted of exportin encoded by emb. Protein complexes containing CycB, Emb, and Nup62 were observed in premeiotic spermatocytes. CycB, which had temporally entered the nucleus, was associated with Emb, and the complex was transported back to the cytoplasm through the central channel, interacting with the Nup62 complex. Conclusion: We proposed that CycB is exported with Emb through the channel interacting with the Nup62 complex before the onset of meiosis. The nuclear export ensures the modification and formation of sufficient CycB-CDK1 in the cytoplasm."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply \"drones\" have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km(2) area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Software Defined Network (SDN) is one of approach for UAV for improving target localization with surveillance for many applications . One of the critical issues for an Unmanned Ariel vehicles (UAVs) landing is the detection of runway in a low visibility conditions with computer vision. Also, the key problem is the accurate and robust detection of runway. A method of runway detection for fixed wing UAVs with a forward-looking camera is uses sensor based communication in network framework between source (UAV'S) and destination (runway sensor). Yet, this depends on the technical experience for landing an UAV's safely. Nowadays, highly advanced equipments are being developed for improving safety and transportation system to handle the problem of landing under low visibility conditions. However, natural or habitual vision could be reduced during low visibility situations. This may be due to many meteorological factors like haze, darkness, fog etc. From the discussion made in this paper, the authors mainly concentrate on managing an aircraft system under low luminosity condition during the landing. In this research, effective Morphological fusion method is employed for the prediction of virtual runway imagery to avoid accident landing process. For this, fusion of sensor data for DEM (Digital Elevation Map) Data, infrared image (IR) and navigation parameter are used. The performance of this research using Morphological fusion method gives a fused image of the runway prediction for UAVs under poor visibility condition. After obtaining the fused image, it is involved in ROI (Region of Interest) contour tracing process to get the clear location of landing of an UAV's without harm. The virtual imaginary model can be produced through contour tracing to predict runway. By this method, a less prediction time or setting time is achieved and maximum accuracy is obtained through simulation using MATLAB tool. Finally, the proposed experimental outcomes are compared with the existing technology. The proposed approach will be use in aircraft sensor based communication between the network (source to destination) to detect the target and to provide a better surveillance for military applications."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}
{"original_data": {"PT": "J", "TI": "A Drone-Based Bioaerosol Sampling System to Monitor Ice Nucleation Particles in the Lower Atmosphere", "DE": "bioaerosol; impinger; impactor; fluorescence; ice nucleation; INPs; sUAS; hydrological cycle", "AB": "Terrestrial ecosystems can influence atmospheric processes by contributing a huge variety of biological aerosols (bioaerosols) to the environment. Several types of biological particles, such as pollen grains, fungal spores, and bacteria cells, trigger freezing processes in super-cooled cloud droplets, and as such can contribute to the hydrological cycle. Even though biogenic particles are known as the most active form of ice nucleation particles (INPs), the transport to high tropospheric altitudes, as well as the occurrence in clouds, remains understudied. Thus, transport processes from the land surface into the atmosphere need to be investigated to estimate weather phenomena and climate trends. To help fill this knowledge gap, we developed a drone-based aerosol particles sampling impinger/impactor (DAPSI) system for field studies to investigate sources and near surface transport of biological INPs. DAPSI was designed to attach to commercial rotary-wing drones to collect biological particles within about 100 m of the Earth's surface. DAPSI provides information on particulate matter concentrations (PM10 & PM2.5), temperature, relative humidity, and air pressure at about 0.5 Hz, by controlling electrical sensors with an onboard computer (Raspberry Pi 3). Two remote-operated sampling systems (impinging and impacting) were integrated into DAPSI. Laboratory tests of the impinging system showed a 96% sampling efficiency for standardized aerosol particles (2 mu m polystyrene latex spheres) and 84% for an aerosol containing biological INPs (Betula pendula). A series of sampling missions (12 flights) were performed using two Phantom 4 quadcopters with DAPSI onboard at a remote sampling site near Gosau, Austria. Fluorescence microscopy of impactor foils showed a significant number of auto-fluorescent particles < 0.5 mu m at an excitation of 465-495 nm and an emission of 515-555 nm. A slight increase in ice nucleation activity (onset temperature between -27 degrees C and -31 degrees C) of sampled aerosol was measured by applying freezing experiments with a microscopic cooling technique. There are a number of unique opportunities for DAPSI to be used to study the transport of bioaerosols, particularly for investigations of biological INP emissions from natural sources such as birch or pine forests."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}

Tidal flats at the south of Shinsi Island near one of the two sluice gates of the Saemangeum dike, display prominent morphologic features known as shelly sand ridges or cheniers (sensu Otvos, 2000) that have migrated landward about 5 m in a year. The tidal flats were dominated by erosion from winter to spring and by deposition during the remainder of the year except for the periods of heavy precipitation when tidal drainage channels became larger and deeper by headward erosion. With overall coarser-grained surface sediments, the presence of actively migrating wave-built cheniers are in stark contrast to muddy tidal flats with a monotonous morphology before the completion of the Saemangeum dike in 2006. Southeasterly waves reflected from the dike during winter to spring when north to northwesterly winds prevail account for the wave-induced onshore sediment transport and rapid morphologic changes in the tidal flats despite their location protected from offshore waves. The diversity and biomass of major macrofauna species tend to increase during rapid erosion and decrease during rapid deposition, highlighting the anthropogenic effect of dike-induced physical disturbance on the benthic ecosystem in the otherwise sheltered tidal flats.

This study develops the logistic regression (LR) model and five typical non-parametric models including, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF) to examine the relationship between influencing factors and vehicle collision risk. Based on the vehicle trajectory data extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos using an automated video analysis system, the unconstrained vehicle motion's collision risk can be evaluated by the extended time to collision (ETTC). Results of model performance comparison indicate that not all non-parametric models have a better prediction performance than the LR model. Specifically, the KNN, SVM, DT and RF models have better model performance than LR model in model training, while the ANN model has the worst model performance. In model prediction, the accuracy of LR model is higher than that of other five non-parametric models under various ETTC thresholds conditions. The LR model implies a pretty good performance and its results also indicate that vehicle yields the higher collision risk when it drives on the left side of toll plaza diverging area and more dangerous situations could be found for an ETC vehicle. Moreover, the vehicle collision risks are positively associated with the speed of the following vehicle and the angle between the leading vehicle speed vector and X axis. Furthermore, the results of DT model show that three factors play important roles in classifying vehicle collision risk and the effects of them on collision risk are consistent with the results of LR model. These findings provide valuable information for accurate assessment of collision risk, which is a key step toward improving safety performance of the toll plaza diverging area."}, "error": "API error: 500", "response": "Internal Server Error", "status": "failed"}
