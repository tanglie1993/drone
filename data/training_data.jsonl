This paper presents an exploratory case study to identify potential applications of visual assets obtained from UASs for construction management tasks. The case study involved the development of a visual assets database from UAS-based images and videos collected during UAS flights at jobsites in the United States and Brazil as well as semi-structured interviews with construction project personnel. The results revealed potential applications of UASs mainly for project progress monitoring, job site logistics, evaluating safety conditions, and quality inspections among other secondary management tasks. In addition, an analysis of costs related to the use of UASs was performed. The main contribution of this case study is a better understanding of the use of UASs for construction management tasks and their regulatory and cost implications.

The 2016 UAS operations were primitive by 2020 standards. Lessons learned are reviewed and related to UAS procedures common today. Two sites in Virginia were selected: a cut slope along State Route 629 (Site 1) and an abandoned shale quarry below Cove Mountain (Site 2). For logistical reasons, a different UAS was used at each of the two sites. Overlapping images from UAS flights were used to create point clouds from which discontinuity orientation data were extracted. Discontinuity data from both UAS and transit compass methods were imported into Dips 7.0, Roc-Plane 3.0, and Swedge 6.0 software for stereonet, statistical, and kinematic analyses. Statistical evaluation of the data sets suggested better overall reliability of UAS results for Site 2 than for Site 1. Compared to transit compass data, Site 1 UAS results are reliable for plane failure analysis only, whereas Site 2 UAS results are reliable for analyzing all types of failure. Possible reasons for this include different drone systems used at the two sites with different navigation and camera characteristics, interference from high-voltage electrical transmission lines at Site 1, and biases in human versus artificial interpretations. Compensating for some identified factors is now simpler by adding surveyed ground-control points to the model. Representative compass data should always be acquired for quality assurance.

Leading logistics companies have been developing and testing their usage of UAVs recently as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective option. In this paper, we investigate how much the UAV delivery service is environmentally friendly compared to the traditional ground vehicle (GV) delivery service. Since there are fuel (battery) and loadable weight restrictions in the UAV delivery, multi-hopping of UAV is necessary, which may cause a large consumption of electrical energy. We present a two-phase approach. In Phase I, a new vehicle routing model to obtain optimal delivery schedules for both UAV-alone and GV-alone delivery systems is proposed, which considers each system's restrictions, such as the max loadable weight and fuel replenishment. In Phase II, CO2 emissions are computed as a sustainability measure based on the travelling distance of the optimal route obtained from Phase I, along with various GV travel-speeds. A case study finds that the UAV-alone delivery system is much more CO2 efficient in all ranges of the GV speeds investigated.

{"TI": "The economic and operational value of using drones to transport vaccines", "DE": "Immunization; UAV; Simulation modeling", "AB": "Background: Immunization programs in low and middle income countries (LMICs) face numerous challenges in getting life-saving vaccines to the people who need them. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has progressed in recent years, potential use cases for UAVs have proliferated due to their ability to traverse difficult terrains, reduce labor, and replace fleets of vehicles that require costly maintenance. Methods: Using a HERMES-generated simulation model, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) for routine vaccine distribution under a range of circumstances reflecting variations in geography, population, road conditions, and vaccine schedules. We also identified the UAV payload and UAS costs necessary for a UAS to be favorable over a traditional multi-tiered land transport system (TMLTS). Results: Implementing the UAS in the baseline scenario improved vaccine availability (96% versus 94%) and produced logistics cost savings of $0.08 per dose administered as compared to the TMLTS. The UAS maintained cost savings in all sensitivity analyses, ranging from $0.05 to $0.21 per dose administered. The minimum UAV payloads necessary to achieve cost savings over the TMLTS, for the various vaccine schedules and UAS costs and lifetimes tested, were substantially smaller (up to 0.40 L) than the currently assumed UAV payload of 1.5 L. Similarly, the maximum UAS costs that could achieve savings over the TMLTS were greater than the currently assumed costs under realistic flight conditions. Conclusion: Implementing a UAS could increase vaccine availability and decrease costs in a wide range of settings and circumstances if the drones are used frequently enough to overcome the capital costs of installing and maintaining the system. Our computational model showed that major drivers of costs savings from using UAS are road speed of traditional land vehicles, the number of people needing to be vaccinated, and the distance that needs to be traveled. 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Vector-borne diseases carry severe public health and economic impacts to over half of the global population yet conventional approaches to the surveillance and treatment of vector habitats is typically laborious and slow. The high mobility of UAVs allows them to reach remote areas that might otherwise be inaccessible to ground-based teams. Given the rapidly expanding examples of these tools in vector control programmes, there is a need to establish the current knowledge base of applications for UAVs in this context and assess the strengths and challenges compared to conventional methodologies. This review aims to summarize the currently available knowledge on the capabilities of UAVs in both malaria control and in vector control more broadly in cases where the technology could be readily adapted to malaria vectors. This review will cover the current use of UAVs in vector habitat surveillance and deployment of control payloads, in comparison with their existing conventional approaches. Finally, this review will highlight the logistical and regulatory challenges in scaling up the use of UAVs in malaria control programmes and highlight potential future developments.

Release of R. latipes is challenging with the current visit-and-hand release approach because P. perfoliata shows a high degree of patchiness in the landscape, possesses recurved barbs on its stems, and often spreads into hard-to-access areas. This 3-year study developed and evaluated unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for precise aerial release of R. latipes to control P. perfoliata. RESULTSWe have developed two UAS (i.e. quad-rotor and tri-rotor) and an aerial release system to disseminate R. latipes. These include pods containing R. latipes and a dispenser to accommodate eight pods. Results of field tests to evaluate the systems showed no significant (P>0.05) effects on survivorship and feeding ability of R. latipes after aerial release. CONCLUSIONOur study demonstrates the potential of UAS for precision aerial release of biological control agents to control invasive plants. The aerial deployment systems we have developed, including both pods and a dispenser, are low cost, logistically practical, and effective with no negative effects on aerially released R. latipes.

To this end, tools deliberately combating this inhibition and advancing technological growth are the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are rapidly taking over major industries such as logistics, security, and cinematography. Among others, this is a very efficient way of carrying out missions unconventional to humans. An application area of this technology is the local film industry which is not producing quality movies primarily due to the lack of technical know-how in utilizing these systems. This study therefore aim to devise an autonomous object tracking UAV system that would eliminate the complex procedure involved in stabilizing an aerial camera (aerial bot) midair and promote the creation of quality aerial video shooting. The study adopted Unified Modeling Language (UML) tools in modeling the system's functionality. The traditional Server-Client model architecture was adopted. The OpenCV library employed proved highly efficient in aiding the tracking procedure. The system provided a usable web controller which provides easy interaction between the pilot and the drone.

This review draws on existing studies on Antarctic UAV vegetation mapping, focusing on their methodologies, including surveyed locations, flight guidelines, UAV specifications, sensor technologies, data processing techniques, and the use of vegetation indices. Despite the potential of established Machine-Learning (ML) classifiers such as Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbour, and Support Vector Machine, and gradient boosting in the semantic segmentation of UAV-captured images, there is a notable scarcity of research employing Deep Learning (DL) models in these extreme environments. While initial studies suggest that DL models could match or surpass the performance of established classifiers, even on small datasets, the integration of these advanced models into real-time navigation systems on UAVs remains underexplored. This paper evaluates the feasibility of deploying UAVs equipped with adaptive path-planning and real-time semantic segmentation capabilities, which could significantly enhance the efficiency and safety of mapping missions in Antarctica.

The use of small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may offer promise for addressing these problems and become a useful tool for many wildlife applications, such as for collecting low-altitude aerial imagery. During 2002 and 2003, we used a 1.5-m wingspan UAV equipped with autonomous control and sophisticated video equipment to test the potential usefulness of such an aircraft for wildlife research applications in Florida, USA. The UAV we used completed > 30 missions (missions averaging 13 km linear distance covered) over 2 years before finally crashing due to engine failure. The UAV captured high-quality, progressive-scan video of a number of landscapes and wildlife species (white ibis [Eudocimus albus], other white wading birds, American alligator [Alligator mississippiensis], and Florida manatee [Trichechus manatus]). The UAV system was unable to collect georeferenced imagery and was difficult to deploy in unimproved areas. The performance of the autonomous control system and the quality of the progressive-scan imagery indicated strong promise for future UAVs as useful field tools.

The incorporation of 5G technologies, satellites, and UAVs has provoked telecommunication networks to advance to provide more stable and high-quality services to remote areas. However, UAVs are vulnerable to cyberattacks because of the rapidly expanding volume and poor inbuilt security. Cyber security and the detection of cyber threats might considerably benefit from the development of artificial intelligence. A machine learning algorithm can be trained to search for attacks that may be similar to other types of attacks. This study proposes a new approach: metaheuristics with machine learning-enabled cybersecurity in unmanned aerial vehicles (MMLCS-UAVs). The presented MMLCS-UAV technique mainly focuses on the recognition and classification of intrusions in the UAV network. To obtain this, the presented MMLCS-UAV technique designed a quantum invasive weed optimization-based feature selection (QIWO-FS) method to select the optimal feature subsets. For intrusion detection, the MMLCS-UAV technique applied a weighted regularized extreme learning machine (WRELM) algorithm with swallow swarm optimization (SSO) as a parameter tuning model. The experimental validation of the MMLCS-UAV method was tested using benchmark datasets. This widespread comparison study reports the superiority of the MMLCS-UAV technique over other existing approaches.

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) carrying visible and near infrared (VNIR) sensors are a suitable nonintrusive mapping platform. UAS deployments in Antarctica are, due to weather and logistical restrictions, infrequent and short, thus it is essential that field time is optimized. This article identified the optimal spectral and spatial resolution of the UAS-based sensors to facilitate efficient data acquisition without jeopardizing the accuracy of remotely sensed moss health indicators. A hyperspectral line scanner was used to collect imagery of two moss study sites near the Casey Australian Antarctic base. The spectral and spatial data degradation simulated two lightweight sensors that could be used for more efficient spectral image acquisition in the future. These simulations revealed that the spectral quality deteriorated more definitively at the spatial resolution where moss spectra started to mix with spectra of surrounding rocks. Subsequently, random forest models (RFMs) were trained with lab measurements for predicting chlorophyll content and effective leaf density. The RFMs were applied to the UAS imagery of the reduced spectral and spatial resolutions to quantify decline in accuracy of both indicators. We identified the optimal UAS sensor capable of mapping a relatively large moss bed (similar to 5 ha) with the prediction accuracy similar to the hyperspectral system. This sensor would be a frame camera acquiring 25 VNIR spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 8 cm. This developed methodology has the potential to be adopted for other similar vegetation biophysical/chemical plant traits.

There is an approach to evaluating its effectiveness based on a generalized multiplicative criterion, which takes into account the features of this system to the maximum extent. It is proposed to single out two particular criteria that characterize the reliability of a UAV and the effectiveness of the control system in relation to it. At the same time, the generalized criterion is a multiplicative convolution based not on the triangular-norm (t-norm) of the particular criterion, but of its correspondence functions, which in a certain way reflect its significance. It is shown that in the particular case of linear dependence of the correspondence functions, the generalized criterion coincides with the classical multiplicative convolution in the form of product of event probabilities. The proposed approach with minimal changes can be adapted to assess the effectiveness of data management systems in heterogeneous networks, process control systems, projects, logistics, etc. C1 [Vititin, Viktor; Kalyagin, Maksim; Kolesnichenko, Valentin] Moscow Inst Aviat Technol, Moscow 125993, Russia.

To address this problem, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) delivery such as drone delivery has been proposed and widely accepted as a promising solution. However, currently most of the existing UAV delivery systems are based on Cloud Computing which cannot efficiently meet the requirements of many real-time services in UAV delivery systems. Meanwhile, the security issues in UAV delivery systems also raise critical concerns due to the existence of multiple participants (such as the sender, middler, and receiver) who may not maintain a mutual trust relationship among them. How to secure the UAV delivery process in such an untrusted environment is still a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and blockchain-based UAV delivery system to resolve the \"last mile\" problem in logistics. Specifically, based on the MEC architecture, the blockchain nodes are deployed on the edge nodes to facilitate and secure the UAV delivery process. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution, a MEC-based UAV delivery system prototype with a private blockchain on the Ethereum platform is implemented. Through the security analysis and performance evaluation, it is proven that our proposed solution can effectively solve the \"last mile\" problem and address the security issues in UAV delivery systems.

UAVs come in a vast variety, from the commercial to the military sectors. The UAVs available today are tiny, mini multirotor devices. The advantages of the small multi-rotor structure are its small size, straightforward design, high hovering effectiveness, adaptability in changing directions, and quick flight speed. For activities like tracking and aerial photography, it is especially useful. However, the majority of multi-rotor UAVs, according to current UAV offers, are built around cameras and sensors. As a result, they can't complete other kinds of missions due to their large overall size, light weight, and small cargoes. The outbreak has sparked interest in and study into whether contactless distribution and logistics are practical. Unmanned mechanical devices for various rescue and specialized duties are also being researched by organizations. Therefore, a medium to big multi-rotor UAV needs to be researched and developed. The assembly of paddle holders and auto-tilters for medium- to large-sized multi-rotor UAVs is examined in this work. The multi-rotor UAV is intended to mount an auto-tilter. Its component strength checks are analyzed. Additionally, the blade requirements are chosen, along with strength tests of the individual components, and the structural design of the UAV rotor system is provided. The mechanical viability of the UAV is then confirmed using a motion simulation of its mechanical design.

Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits. Nevertheless, it was apparent that with the right implementation plan, UAVs possess the potential to overcome the shortcomings in the healthcare logistics of low-income countries.

This is because performing a task using UAV makes the job more efficient and reduces the workload needed. However, for a UAV to be operated manually or autonomously, the UAV must be equipped with proper safety features. An anti-collision system is one of the most crucial and fundamental safety features that UAVs must be equipped with. The anti-collision system allows the UAV to maintain a safe distance from any obstacles. The anti-collision technologies are of crucial relevance to assure the survival and safety of UAVs. Anti-collision of UAVs can be varied in the aspect of sensor usage and the system's working principle. This article provides a comprehensive overview of anti-collision technologies for UAVs. It also presents drone safety laws and regulations that prevent a collision at the policy level. The process of anti-collision technologies is studied from three aspects: Obstacle detection, collision prediction, and collision avoidance. A detailed overview and comparison of the methods of each element and an analysis of their advantages and disadvantages have been provided.

The VNPRPTmD model improves delivery efficiency by utilizing consumer segregation and clustering, routing optimization, and multi-vehicle collaborative routing. The concept enables UAVs to operate with flexibility, departing from and returning to any specified spot, hence eliminating the requirement to return to their original location.

In this study we assessed the level of disturbance that a range of UAV shapes and sizes had on free-living non-breeding waterfowl surveyed in two sites in eastern Australia between March and May 2015, as well as the capability of airborne digital imaging systems to provide adequate resolution for unambiguous species identification of these taxa. We found little or no obvious disturbance effects on wild, mixed-species flocks of waterfowl when UAVs were flown at least 60m above the water level (fixed wing models) or 40m above individuals (multirotor models). Disturbance in the form of swimming away from the UAV through to leaving the water surface and flying away from the UAV was visible at lower altitudes and when fixed-wing UAVs either approached subjects directly or rapidly changed altitude arid/or direction near animals. Using tangential approach flight paths that did not cause disturbance, commercially available onboard optical equipment was able to capture images of sufficient quality to identify waterfowl and even much smaller taxa such as swallows. Our results show that with proper planning of take-off and landing sites, flight paths and careful UAV model selection, UAVs can provide an excellent tool for accurately surveying wild waterfowl populations and provide archival data with fewer logistical issues than traditional methods such as manned aerial surveys.

Ground-based line transects are typically conducted to estimate and monitor primate populations. However, transects may be costly and logistically challenging. We sought to test whether low-cost (<5,000 USD), ready-to-use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could effectively monitor primate populations in north-eastern Madagascar. Critically Endangered [A3cd] golden-crowned sifakas (Propithecus tattersalli) are medium-sized, white lemurs whose creamy colour contrasts against defoliated tree canopies, making them an ideal study species for aerial counts. Quad-copter UAV flights over sifaka groups did not elicit antipredator responses. Photographs demonstrated the ability of UAVs to capture viable imagery of sifakas from approximately 20 m above ground level. Unfortunately, crashes resulting from an inability to programme automated flights over hilly forests cut this pilot study short, highlighting several challenges that remain to implementing UAVs in remote field studies. This study demonstrates that while UAVs offer considerable promise in the future of primate research and conservation, high start-up costs and remote field conditions provide challenging obstacles to first time users hoping to use this exciting new technology. Furthermore, we strongly recommend that thermal cameras be used for direct primate counts with UAVs.

Previous studies often based their UAV logistics delivery strategies on Manhattan distance. However, these methods face difficulties when dealing with the complexities of multi-user scenarios, low-altitude communication, and the non-convex nature of the problem. Innovative approaches are needed to overcome these challenges. This study explores a multi-user UAV cargo delivery system, where a cellular-connected UAV efficiently collects and distributes packages within a delivery area. Balancing task completion speed and reliable communication with ground base stations (GBS) poses challenges due to the problem's highly non-convex nature. To address this, we propose a two-step approach. Initially, leveraging a graph-theoretic method under communication quality constraints, we determine the shortest path between points ensuring communication connectivity. Subsequently, considering pickup and delivery with capacity constraints based on communication connectivity (PDPCC), we present an efficient solution for obtaining the optimal task sequence and integrating it with the shortest paths. Our numerical results demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy in reducing delivery task completion time while ensuring continuous online UAV operation through maintained communication connectivity.

Efficacy assessment was based on the technological, logistical, administrative, and economic requirements of pre (planning), peri (image acquiring) and post (image processing) phases.

Administratively, the first deployment of UASs is less efficient but was very flexible for subsequent deployment. Manned aircraft flights were more productive in terms of the number of acquired images, but the ground resolution of those images was lower compared with those from UASs.

One of these AI technologies is using efficient and secure multi-environment Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) for anti-submarine attacks. This study's contribution is the early detection of a submarine assault employing hybrid environment UVs that are controlled using swarm optimization and secure the information in between UVs using a decentralized cybersecurity strategy. The Dragonfly Algorithm is used for the orientation and clustering of the UVs in the optimization approach, and the Re-fragmentation strategy is used in the Network layer of the TCP/IP protocol as a cybersecurity solution. The research's noteworthy findings demonstrate UVs' logistical capability to promptly detect the target and address the problem while securely keeping the drone's geographical information. The results suggest that detecting the submarine early increases the likelihood of averting a collision. The dragonfly strategy of sensing the position of the submersible and aggregating around it demonstrates the reliability of swarm intelligence in increasing access efficiency. Securing communication between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) improves the level of secrecy necessary for the task. The swarm navigation is based on a peer-to-peer system, which allows each UAV to access information from its peers. This, in turn, helps the UAVs to determine the best route to take and to avoid collisions with other UAVs. The dragonfly strategy also increases the speed of the mission by minimizing the time spent finding the target.

UAVs are adaptable to various cryospheric research needs in terms of providing flexibility with data acquisition windows, revisits, data/sensor types (multispectral, hyperspectral, microwave, thermal/night imaging, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and photogrammetric stereos), viewing angles, flying altitudes, and overlap dimensions. Thus, UAVs have the potential to act as a bridging remote sensing platform between spatially discrete in situ observations and spatially continuous but coarser and costlier spaceborne or conventional airborne remote sensing. In recent years, a number of studies using UAVs for cryospheric research have been published. However, a holistic review discussing the methodological advancements, hardware and software improvements, results, and future prospects of such cryospheric studies is completely missing. In the present scenario of rapidly changing global and regional climate, studying cryospheric changes using UAVs is bound to gain further momentum and future studies will benefit from a balanced review on this topic. Our review covers the most recent applications of UAVs within glaciology, snow, permafrost, and polar research to support the continued development of high-resolution investigations of cryosphere. We also analyze the UAV and sensor hardware, and data acquisition and processing software in terms of popularity for cryospheric applications and revisit the existing UAV flying regulations in cold regions of the world. The recent usage of UAVs outlined in 103 case studies provide expertise that future investigators should base decisions on. C1 [Gaffey, Clare] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.

Logistics companies, therefore, must implement innovative technologies or services in their logistics processes. It is critical to adopt unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in last mile delivery and urban logistics. The service provider applies the characteristics of UAVs to complete more requests, benefiting more revenue. However, it may not be a satisfactory solution, because the customers will be dissatisfied if the actual delivery time does not align with their expectations. This study constructs a revenue maximization model subject to time windows and customer satisfaction. Instead of addressing the traveling salesmen problem, this model takes new customer requests during the delivery process into account. We solved the problem using a genetic algorithm. The results show: (1) the model found an approximate and effective solution in the real-time delivery environment; (2) customer satisfaction is inversely proportional to the total delivery distance; (3) regarding the result of the sensitivity analysis of this study, investment in UAV has no influence on total profit and customer satisfaction. Moreover, the customer is a key factor in the logistics decision-making platform, not the provider's investment in UAVs.

UAVs, like satellites and aircraft can provide a synoptic view of a relatively large area. However, the coarse resolution provided by satellites and the operational limitations of manned aircraft has motivated the development of unmanned systems. UAVs offer unparalleled flexibility of tasking; for example, low altitude flight and slow airspeed allow for the characterization of a wide variety of geophysical phenomena at the ocean surface and in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Here, we present the development of cutting-edge payload instrumentation for UAVs that provides a new capability for ship-deployed operations to capture a unique, high resolution spatial and temporal variability of the changing air-sea interaction processes than was previously possible. The modular design of the base payload means that new instruments can be incorporated into new research proposals that may include new instruments for expanded use of the payloads as a long-term research facility. Additionally, we implement a novel capability for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) from research vessels. This VTOL capability is safer and requires less logistical support than previous ship-deployed systems. The payloads developed include thermal infrared, visible broadband and hyperspectral, and near-infrared hyperspectral high-resolution imaging. Additional capabilities include quantification of the longwave and shortwave hemispheric radiation budget (up- and down-welling) as well as direct air-sea turbulent fluxes. Finally, a UAV-deployed dropsonde-microbuoy was developed in order to profile the temperature, pressure and humidity of the atmosphere and the temperature and salinity of the near-surface ocean. These technological advancements provide the next generation of instrumentation capability for UAVs. When deployed from research vessels, UAVs will provide a transformational science prism unequaled using 1-D data snapshots from ships or moorings alone.

There are notable impediments to the utilization of commercial logistic-oriented fixed-wing UAVs, including elevated procurement and maintenance costs, extensive maintenance intervals, and unsuitability for small-volume, low-altitude transport tasks. These factors collectively exacerbate the risk associated with enterprise procurement and elevate the cost-benefit ratio. This study introduces the design and fabrication of a cost-efficient UAV for logistic delivery purposes, constructed primarily from cost-effective wood materials. This UAV is engineered to ferry payloads of up to 1000 g across a predefined aerial route at an altitude of 40 m. Upon reaching the designated location, the UAV is programmed to initiate the identification of the drop zone, thereafter descending to facilitate the release of the cargo. To mitigate the impact force during the landing phase, the payload was encapsulated within a sponge-damping layer, thereby preserving the integrity of the transported items. The empirical findings from outdoor delivery trials underscore the UAV's ability to precisely execute payload drops at the targeted locations, confirming its potential to fulfill the logistical requirements for the transportation and delivery of small-volume items in a cost-effective, low-altitude framework. This investigation contributes to the burgeoning discourse on leveraging ultra-low-cost UAVs in logistics, offering a feasible solution to the challenges of cost and efficiency in UAV-operated delivery systems.

In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight; flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to rendezvous with the truck.

We propose a novel framework that combines the strengths of cipher block chaining, physical layer security, and symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques in order to safely encrypt the transaction logs of remote delivery operations. The proposed approach is shown to provide high security levels, making the keys undetectable, in addition to being robust to attacks. Thus, it is very useful in drone systems used for logistics and autonomous goods delivery to multiple destinations.

Unmanned autonomous intelligent systems (UAISs), as a physical form of artificial intelligence (AI), have gained significant attention from academia and industry. These systems have various applications in autonomous driving, logistics, area surveillance, and medical services. With the rapid evolution of information and communication technology (ICT), 5G and beyond-5G communication have enabled numerous intelligent applications through the comprehensive utilization of advanced NTN communication technology and artificial intelligence. To meet the demands of complex tasks in remote or communication-challenged areas, there is an urgent need for reliable, ultra-low latency communication networks to enable unmanned autonomous intelligent systems for applications such as localization, navigation, perception, decision-making, and motion planning. However, in remote areas, reliable communication coverage is not available, which poses a significant challenge for intelligent systems applications. The rapid development of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) communication has shed new light on intelligent applications that require ubiquitous network connections in space, air, ground, and sea. However, challenges arise when using NTN technology in unmanned autonomous intelligent systems. Our research examines the advancements and obstacles in academic research and industry applications of NTN technology concerning UAIS, which is supported by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and other low-altitude platforms. Nevertheless, edge computing and cloud computing are crucial for unmanned autonomous intelligent systems, which also necessitate distributed computation architectures for computationally intensive tasks and massive data offloading.

An hourly trip generation model was applied to create 1138 trips in two scenarios comparing the cartesian discretization to our proposed algorithm. The results show that the AAM enables a precise airspace capacity/cost estimation, due to its detailed 3D generation capabilities.

Ice jams can cause levees to burst, leading to severe flooding, property damage, and human casualties. Hence, there is an urgent need to carry out observations of ice conditions and make risk assessments of ice jam occurrence. Field observation is the most reliable technique, but it is usually too expensive and time-consuming, which has led to the evaluation of applied remote sensing for data capture and analysis. Owing to the factors of timeliness, image resolution, human safety, and cost, satellite or manned aerial remote sensing cannot fully meet the requirements of ice condition observation. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing system is proposed for the collection of river ice imagery, providing the benefits of low cost, flexible launch and landing logistics, safety, and appropriate hyperspatial image resolution. One Inner Mongolian segment of the Yellow River was chosen as a test area to demonstrate key technologies and specific procedures of observation and assessment of ice conditions using the UAV system. The specific UAV remote sensing system and its components are introduced along with the procedures of UAV operation and imagery acquisition. Image preprocessing techniques and ice information extraction are described in detail followed by analysis and risk assessment of the ice conditions based on the resulting panoramic imagery. Results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the fixed-wing UAV system to rapid observation and risk assessment of ice jam formation over the Yellow River under harsh weather conditions including low temperatures and strong winds.

We combine unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), thermal imagery and computer vision to improve traditional wildlife survey methods. During spring 2015, we flew fixed-wing UAS equipped with thermal sensors, imaging two grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) breeding colonies in eastern Canada. Human analysts counted and classified individual seals in imagery manually. Concurrently, an automated classification and detection algorithm discriminated seals based upon temperature, size, and shape of thermal signatures. Automated counts were within 95-98% of human estimates; at Saddle Island, the model estimated 894 seals compared to analyst counts of 913, and at Hay Island estimated 2188 seals compared to analysts' 2311. The algorithm improves upon shortcomings of computer vision by effectively recognizing seals in aggregations while keeping model setup time minimal.

Previous research has been conducted on the use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) to conduct hippo population estimates; however, findings either needed justification through additional field testing or used high-cost UASs that may be unaffordable for management authorities in developing countries in Africa. Therefore, using a low-cost, consumer-grade, DJI Phantom 3 Advanced multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), 47 surveys were conducted of the hippo population at Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR), South Africa, between August 2016 and July 2017. In addition, comparisons were drawn between the results of and the logistical requirements and costs of the respective helicopter and UAV surveys conducted on the same day of the same hippo population. The use of a consumer-grade UAV permitted frequent, accurate, and comparatively low-cost surveys to identify temporal changes in the number of hippos present in NGR and at different locations within NGR.

However, existing Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) systems are highly vulnerable to spoofing, data falsification, and cyber threats, which compromises air traffic management and poses significant challenges to UAV security. This paper presents an innovative approach to improving UAV security by introducing a novel steganographic method for ADS-B data protection. The proposed method leverages Fourier transformation to embed UAV identifiers into ADS-B signals, ensuring a high level of concealment and robustness against signal distortions. A key feature of the approach is the dynamic parameter management system, which adapts to varying transmission conditions to minimize distortions and enhance resilience. Experimental validation demonstrates that the method achieves a tenfold reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) compared to existing techniques such as mp3stego while also improving the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared to s-tools. The proposed solution ensures compliance with existing ADS-B standards, maintaining seamless integration with air traffic management systems while enhancing cybersecurity measures. By safeguarding UAV communications, the method contributes to the sustainable development of smart cities and supports critical applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and emergency response operations. These findings confirm the practical feasibility of the proposed approach and its potential to strengthen UAV security and ADS-B data protection, ultimately contributing to the resilience and sustainability of urban airspace infrastructure.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a major role in contemporary battles by collecting intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and aiding tactical procedures. Although the intricate interlinking of these systems and the high rate of cyber risk pose security challenges, there are ways to overcome them. Traditional security approaches based on border patrols and protective measures are unreliable against advanced and persistent threats. As a result, the Zero Trust (ZT) approach, which operates under the notion that no faith can be taken for granted in the network, is certainly the most appropriate way to deal with this issue. The main purpose of zero trust in UAV security is to reduce the vulnerability of the system to cyber threats. The core of zero trust is based on observing all activities and risks. This approach will help military UAV operators allow only genuine users to access UAV systems, thereby reducing the possibility of illegal access, hacking, and data breaches. This project aims to analyze the applicability of a zero-trust architecture model and machine learning to enhance the security of military drones.

However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP.

The efficient delivery of packages by drone may be one of the most promising applications of this technology. In logistic UAV missions, due to the limited capacities of power supplies, such as fuel or batteries, it is almost impossible for one unmanned vehicle to visit multiple wide areas. Thus, multiple unmanned vehicles with well-planned routes become necessary to minimize the unnecessary consumption of time, distance, and energy while carrying out the delivery missions. The aim of the present study was to develop a multiple-vehicle mission dispatch system that can automatically compile a set of optimal paths and avoid passing through no-travel zones. For this function, the A* search algorithm was adopted to determine an alternative path that does not cross the no-travel zone when the distance array is set, and an improved two-phased Tabu search was applied to converge any initial solutions into a feasible solution. In this study, a group of five multicopters was set up to validate the swarm system, and the result shows that our improved 2TS+2OPT is able to converge to a better solution that allows logistic UAV swarms to operate in a more efficient way.

However, the utilization of UAV swarms in sustainable transportation also presents some challenges, such as inefficient task allocation and data transmission security issues, highlighting the importance of privacy protection in this context. To address these issues, this study applies blockchain technology to multi-UAV tasks and proposes a blockchain-based multi-UAV task processing system for situation awareness and real-time decisions. The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency of UAV swarm task scheduling, bolster data transmission security, and address privacy protection concerns. Utilizing the highly secure features of blockchain technology, the system constructs a distributed task processing network. System tasks are stored in the blockchain through smart contracts, ensuring the immutability and verifiability of task information. Smart contracts have an automatic execution capability, whereby the system can efficiently coordinate tasks and maintain the consistency of task execution information through consensus mechanisms. Additionally, adopting the Pointer Network structure for intelligent path planning based on task allocation results leads to the attainment of the shortest service routes, consequently expanding the service coverage of sustainable transportation systems while reducing energy consumption. This further advances the realization of urban sustainable transportation. Through experimental results, we verify that the proposed system enables real-time task scheduling and collaborative processing for multiple UAVs, significantly enhancing the efficiency, security, and privacy protection level of UAV swarm task execution in the context of sustainable transportation. It makes a positive contribution to building more sustainable urban transportation systems.

More importantly, the UAV-borne aeromagnetometry can be performed at low altitudes, which makes it possible to resolve fine features otherwise only evident in ground surveys. Developing such a UAV-borne aeromagnetometry system is challenging owing to strong magnetic interference introduced by onboard electric and electronic components. An experiment concerning the static magnetic interference of the UAV was conducted to assess the severity of the interference of a hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV. The results of the static experiment show that the wing area is highly magnetic due to the proximity to servomotors and motors, whereas the area along the longitudinal axis of the UAV has a relatively smaller magnetic signature. Assisted by the static experiment and aerodynamic simulations, we first proposed a front-mounting solution with two compact magnetometers. Subsequently, two dynamic experiments were conducted with the setup to assess the dynamic interference of the system. The results of the dynamic experiments reveal that the strongest source of in-flight magnetic interference is the current-carrying cables connecting the battery to the flight controller and that this effect is most influential during pitch maneuvers of the aircraft.

With the maturity of unmanned technology, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is becoming a promising alternative to the problematic manual inspection. However, due to the lack of GPS signal indoor, the localization of UAVs is a big challenge to achieve fully autonomous inspection. Moreover, the narrow and complex indoor environment makes it difficult to guarantee flight safety. This paper presents a UAV-based explore-then-exploit system to tackle these problems for autonomous indoor facility data collection and scene reconstruction. The proposed system consists of a hardware description and integration of two UAVs, a two-step simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method for UAV localization and 3D environmental mapping, a safety-guaranteed coverage path planning algorithm for inspection and data collection, as well as an obstacle-aware trajectory generation method. The proposed system is examined in GPS-denied and cluttered indoor environment and 3D scene reconstruction is conducted. The quantitative analysis shows that the positioning accuracy is centimeter -level and the reconstruction error is within 3 cm. The performance analysis demonstrates the robustness and feasibility of our system in reconstructing and inspecting complex indoor environments for high-efficiency and low-cost facility management.

Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This \"Ecosynth\" methodology applies photogrammetric \"Structure from Motion\" computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (<130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (<USD$4000), lightweight (<2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30-67 points M-2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 625 ha (250 m x 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2-4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4-12 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R-2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31-36% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m x 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology. Inexpensive user-deployed technologies for multispectral 3D scanning of vegetation at landscape scales (<1 km(2)) heralds a new era of participatory remote sensing by field ecologists, community foresters and the interested public.

With recent humanitarian field tests of cargo UAVs as indication that implementation may soon become reality, a priori assessment of a smart-navigated (autonomous) UAV disaster cargo fleet via simulation modeling and analysis is vital to the best-practice development process. Logistical problems with ground transport of relief supplies in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (2017) pose a compelling use scenario for UAV disaster cargo delivery. In this context, we introduce a General Purpose Assessment Model (GPAM) that can estimate the potential effectiveness of a cargo UAV fleet for any given response region. We evaluate this model using the following standards: (i) realistic specifications; (ii) stable output for various realistic specifications; and (iii) support of humanitarian goals. To this end, we discuss data from humanitarian cargo delivery field tests and feedback from practitioners, perform sensitivity analyses, and demonstrate the advantage of using humanitarian rather than geographic distance in making fleet delivery assignments. We conclude with several major challenges faced by those who wish to implement smart-navigated UAV cargo fleets in disaster response, and the need for further GPAM development. This paper proposes the GPAM as a useful simulation tool to encourage and guide steps toward humanitarian use of UAVs for cargo delivery. The model's flexibility can allow organizations to quickly and effectively determine how best to respond to disasters.

In the civil field, UAVs are generally used as an auxiliary tool to deal with urban problems, but buildings are the main factors hindering the flight of UAVs. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the optimal flight path of UAVs under certain constraints. The intelligent logistics UAV proposed in this paper is used to replace the courier to deliver small goods. It is a quadcopter integrated with a web cam, ultrasound ground proximity warning system (GPWS), and is controllable through a mobile APP. Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and improved proportion-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are applied in its flight control system. In the path planning, compared with the traditional A* algorithm and artificial potential field algorithm, the ant colony algorithm and dynamic path planning used in this paper can quickly solve the optimal path of UAV in complex terrain. UAV can detect the working state of components during flight and the surrounding obstacles.

The flexible maneuverability of UAVs also means that the UAV often operates in complex 3D environments, which requires efficient and reliable path planning system support. However, as a limited resource platform, the UAV systems cannot support highly complex path planning algorithms in lots of scenarios. In this paper, we propose a 3D spatial information compression (3DSIC) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for UAV path planning in cluttered 3D environments. Specifically, the proposed algorithm compresses the 3D spatial information to 2D through 3DSIC, and then combines the compressed 2D environment information with the current UAV layer spatial information to train UAV agents for path planning using neural networks. Additionally, the proposed 3DSIC is a plug and use module that can be combined with various DRL frameworks such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Our simulation results show that the training efficiency of 3DSIC-DQN is 4.028 times higher than that directly implementing DQN in a $100 \\times 100 \\times 50$ 3D cluttered environment. Furthermore, the training efficiency of 3DSIC-DDPG is 3.9 times higher than the traditional DDPG in the same environment. Moreover, 3DSIC combined with fast recurrent stochastic value gradient (FRSVG), which can be considered as the most state-of-the-art DRL algorithm for UAV path planning, exhibits 2.35 times faster training speed compared with the original FRSVG algorithm.

UAVs provide various services to users, including monitoring, logistics, and sensing, because of their flexible deployment and dynamic reconfigurability. However, UAV networks have become more susceptible to malicious threats because of their multiconnectivity and openness. A great effort has been made to develop an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) based on machine-learning approaches for UAVs. Unfortunately, existing methods were unable to identify real time and zero-day attacks for UAV networks. This is due to that existing methods have still used obsolete data sets and past knowledge-based detection. Also, the shortcomings of standalone IDS render them unsuitable for defending UAV networks from potential security risks. Further, the lack of precise identification for compromised UAV nodes in UAV networks poses a critical security gap, risking the entire network's integrity with the compromise of a single node. Therefore, in this work, we propose an autonomous collaborative IDS (UAV-CIDS) with a feedforward convolutional neural network (FFCNN), which accurately identifies zero-day with high accuracy. The proposed solution takes into account encoded Wi-Fi traffic logs of three popular UAVs types: 1) DBPower UDI; 2) parrot Bebop; and 3) DJI spark. Evaluation results indicate that our FFCNN model has produced outstanding results based on the UAVIDS data set with 98.23% accuracy compared to existing models. After the detection of attacks, their mitigation is equally significant. In addition, we also design and implement real-time incident response handling against cyber-attacks on UAV Networks. The incident response handling will assist in minimizing the effects of a security breach, remediate vulnerabilities and systematically secure the entire UAV networks.

To identify optimal service provisioning plans, we design a novel Energy-Aware Holistic Service Provisioning Mechanism based on Particle Swarm Optimization (ES-PSO), which minimizes delivery energy consumption while adhering to service deadline constraints.

Nevertheless, there are still many divisive changes that need to be made in order to implement UAVs into a country's humanitarian sector successfully. Hence, this paper aims to analyze the various barriers hindering the implementation of UAVs in humanitarian logistics for both developed and developing nations. To accomplish this, the study is presented in three steps. First, previous literature and opinions from experts are analyzed to illuminate particular factors that hinder UAV implementation. Next, we propose an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) based graph theory and matrix approach (GTMA) to calculate a drone implementation hindrance index (DIHI). The GTMA method used in this paper utilizes the PERMAN algorithm to calculate the permanent function. Finally, the DIHI values are plotted and analyzed to compare the readiness of drone implementation between developed and developing economies. A sensitivity analysis is then performed to provide validity to the results obtained. The study has revealed that both types of countries must first improve their inadequate government regulations regarding humanitarian UAVs. Developing countries must also focus on enhancing the technological awareness of their population. The results of this study can be used by policymakers and practitioners to smoothly implement UAVs in their country's humanitarian sector.

Optimal use of UAVs in dynamic environments is important in many aspects, e.g., increasing efficacy and reducing the air traffic, resulting in a safer environment, and it requires new techniques and robust approaches based on the capabilities of UAVs and constraints. This paper analyzes several delivery schemes within a platform, such as delivery with and without using air highways and delivery using a hybrid scheme along with several delivery methods (i.e., optimal, premium, and first-in first-out) to explore the use of UAV swarms as part of the logistics operations. In this platform, a dimension reduction technique, \"dynamic multiple assignments in multidimensional space,\" and several other new techniques along with Hungarian and cross-entropy Monte Carlo techniques are forged together to assign tasks and plan 3D routes dynamically. This particular approach is performed in such a way that UAV swarms in several warehouses are deployed optimally given the delivery scheme, method, and constraints. Several scenarios are tested on the simulator using small and big data sets. The results show that the distribution and the characteristics of data sets and constraints affect the decision on choosing the optimal delivery scheme and the method. The findings are expected to guide the aviation authorities in their decisions before dictating rules and regulations regarding effective, efficient, and safe use of UAVs. Furthermore, the companies that produce UAVs are going to take the demonstrated results into account for their functional design of UAVs along with other companies that aim to deliver their products using UAVs. Additionally, private industries, logistics operators, and municipalities are expected to benefit from the potential adoption of the simulator in strategic decisions before embarking on the practical implementation of UAV delivery systems.

{"TI": "An Operational Capacity Assessment Method for an Urban Low-Altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Logistics Route Network", "DE": "air traffic management; airspace management; capacity assessment; urban air mobility; UAV logistics", "AB": "The Federal Aviation Administration introduced the concept of urban air mobility (UAM), a new three-dimensional transport system that operates with a fusion of manned/unmanned aerial vehicles on an urban or intercity scale. The rapid development of UAM has brought innovation and dynamism to many industries, especially in the field of logistics. Various types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for use in transport logistics are being designed and produced. UAV logistics refers to the use of UAVs, usually carrying goods and parcels, to achieve route planning, identify risk perception, facilitate parcel delivery, and carry out other functions. This research provides a method for assessing the operational capacity of a UAV logistics route network. The concept of \"logistics UAV route network operation capacity\" is defined, and a bi-objective optimization model for assessing the route network's operating capacity is developed. The first objective is to maximize the number of UAV logistics delivery plans that can be executed in a fixed operation time. The second objective is to minimize the total operational impedance value in a fixed operation time. To solve the bi-objective optimization model, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is utilized. A UAV logistics route network with 62 nodes is developed to assess the rationale and validity of the proposed concept. The experiments show that with an increase in operation time, the route network's optimal operational capacity gradually increases, the convergence speed of the algorithm slows down, and the optimization magnitude gradually reduces. Two key parameters-operational safety interval and flight speed-are further analyzed in the experiments. According to the experiments, as the safety interval increases, the route network's average operational capacity steadily diminishes, as does its sensitivity to the safety interval. The average operational capacity steadily rose with the rise in flight speed, especially when the UAV logistics flight speed was between 10 m/s and 10.5 m/s. In that range, the operational capacity of the route network was substantially impacted by the flight speed.

The combination of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) with structure from motion (SfM) methods have already revolutionized the current close-range Earth observation paradigm. To test their feasibility in characterizing the properties and dynamics of fast ice, three flights were carried out in the 2016-2017 austral summer during the 33rd Chinese National Antarctic Expedition (CHINARE), focusing on the area of the Prydz Bay in East Antarctica. Three-dimensional models and orthomosaics from three sorties were constructed from a total of 205 photos using Agisoft PhotoScan software. Logistical challenges presented by the terrain precluded the deployment of a dedicated ground control network; however, it was still possible to indirectly assess the performance of the photogrammetric products through an analysis of the statistics of the matching network, bundle adjustment, and Monte-Carlo simulation. Our results show that the matching networks are quite strong, given a sufficient number of feature points (mostly > 20,000) or valid matches (mostly > 1000). The largest contribution to the total error using our direct georeferencing approach is attributed to inaccuracies in the onboard position and orientation system (POS) records, especially in the vehicle height and yaw angle. On one hand, the 3D precision map reveals that planimetric precision is usually about one-third of the vertical estimate (typically 20 cm in the network centre). On the other hand, shape-only errors account for less than 5% for the X and Y dimensions and 20% for the Z dimension. To further illustrate the UAS's capability, six representative surface features are selected and interpreted by sea ice experts. Finally, we offer pragmatic suggestions and guidelines for planning future UAS-SfM surveys without the use of ground control. The work represents a pioneering attempt to comprehensively assess UAS-SfM survey capability in fast ice environments, and could serve as a reference for future improvements.

In this paper, air-to-ground (AG) channel measurements are carried out at some candidate frequencies, i.e., 1 GHz, 4 GHz, 12 GHz, and 24 GHz. With measurement data, the crucial channel parameters are comprehensively analyzed. Firstly, based on the channel model in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the essential coefficients for modeling path loss, including path loss exponents (PLEs) and height-dependent factors, are obtained for AG channels. Then, a novel autocorrelation model for shadow fading is proposed. Besides, the small-scale fading is statistically analyzed, where the log-logistic distribution is found as the best fit among popular distributions. Moreover, the second-order statistical characteristics, including the level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD), are extracted to describe in-depth the fading behavior. Overall, the results and findings in this paper are essential for realizing reliable communications in AG wireless systems.

However, traditional human courier based delivery modes face many problems, such as high costs, slow speeds, and uncertain arrival times due to traffic conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes leveraging heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and human couriers for emergency medical delivery, and develops a Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based method for real-time joint scheduling. The problem is modelled as a multi-depot capacitated pickup and delivery problem with soft deadlines. A DRL-based method is proposed with two types of agent networks for UAVs and human couriers, respectively, which could capture their distinct features and delivery strategies. In addition, a cooperative network is introduced to coordinate their operations. Extensive computational experiments and a real-life case study are conducted that verifies the superiority of our methods over several benchmark algorithms in different scenarios, and demonstrates its feasibility and performance in practical scenarios.

However, due to the reliability of the UAV system and the complex and changeable operation scene and population distribution in the urban environment, a few ground-impact accidents have occurred and generated enormous risks to ground personnel. In order to reduce the risk of UAV ground-impact accidents in the urban logistical scene, failure causal factors, and failure modes were classified and summarized in the process of UAV operation based on the accumulated operation data of more than 20,000 flight hours. The risk assessment model based on the Bayesian network was built. According to the established network and the probability of failure causal factors, the probabilities of ground impact accidents and intermediate events under different working conditions were calculated, respectively. The posterior probability was carried out based on the network topology to deduce the main failure inducement of the accidents. Mitigation measures were established to achieve the equivalent safety level of manned aviation, aiming at the main causes of accidents. The results show that the safety risk of the UAV was reduced to 3.84 x 10(-8) under the action of risk-mitigation measures.

The scientific identification of the spatial pattern and impact factors of UAV logistics networks is greatly significant in regards to UAV logistics planning and scheduling. This study considered the urban logistics network of Hangzhou in 2020 as the research topic and used kernel density estimation, a geodetector, and geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis technology to systematically analyze the spatial patterns and influencing factors at the city and district scales. The study found that a significant spatial pattern was revealed in the UAV logistics network in Hangzhou, and the logistics nodes showed an obvious \"core-edge\" structure. The urban population, market scale and logistics infrastructure jointly shaped the structure and function of the UAV logistics network, and logistics nodes had a strong coupling relationship with the urban spatial structure. Through interaction detectors, the technical route of urban UAV logistics network construction was analyzed and summarized, and results can provide a scientific basis and case reference for other cities to build and plan UAV logistics networks.

In order to deal with this non-linear complex system with a changing mass, further research on modelling and control must be developed. In this work, a new intelligent control strategy is proposed and applied to a quadrotor with a cable-suspended load. The UAV carrying a suspended load has two different dynamic behaviors, depending on the state of the cable. Thus, we proposed to model the complete system using the hybrid automata formalism. Using this novel UAV model approach, a hybrid control is designed based on feedback linearization controllers combined with an artificial neural network, which acts as an online estimator of the unknown mass. The suspended load is dealt with as an external disturbance. Simulation results show how the on-line learning control scheme increases the robustness of the control and it is able to stabilize the quadrotor without any information about neither the position of the load nor the tension of the cable. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposal is studied to show the feasibility of the implementation of this intelligent control strategy on real hardware.

Owing to the spatiotemporal limitations of existing datasets, budgetary constraints, logistical challenges, and adverse temperature and climatic conditions of Antarctica, researchers face great challenges. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have helped to solve this issue because they can collect high-resolution spatiotemporal data and conduct operations in inaccessible locations at a low cost and with ease compared with in situ observation and conventional spaceborne and airborne remote sensing. The development and testing of UAVs for use in polar environments mainly focus on enhancing UAV performance in extreme Antarctic conditions by improving their endurance, wind resistance, and aerial photography stability. The equipped multisensors, flexible data collection and operation window, and high-spatiotemporal resolution all contribute to making UAVs the most powerful platform for cryospheric research. In recent years, a series of UAV-related studies on the cryosphere have been published. However, a thorough review that explicitly details the scientific progress and possibilities of using UAVs in Antarctic polar research is lacking. In this era of rapid global and regional climate change, it is becoming increasingly necessary to employ UAVs to investigate the finer changes in the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) and ice shelves. This work investigates the use of UAVs in the monitoring of the glacial microtopography (including rifts and crevasses, surface subsidence, and melting ponds), ice surface landforms, atmosphere, flora and fauna, sea ice, subglacial environment, and other aspects of Antarctic glaciology investigation, and it speculates on their future use in multidisciplinary research.

However, the limited computing capability and restricted battery lifetime of existing UAVs could significantly impact the quality of service (QoS) of UAV-based smart systems and the quality of experience (QoE) of end users. Recently, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) which provisions computing resources close to the mobile end devices has become a promising solution. However, since high-speed UAV often flies through the signal range of the different edge nodes, the interruption of services in the MEC-based UAV delivery system is a critical issue. A challenging question is when and how to perform dynamic task migration among the edge nodes to ensure service continuity. In this paper, we investigate the task migration issue for multiple UAVs in the MEC-based UAV delivery system. Specifically, we propose an energy-aware decision-making strategy for the dynamic task migration named GAD to optimize the UAV energy consumption. Given the real-time system status and QoS constraints, and through a dynamic two-tier decision-making mechanism, GAD can efficiently make the task migration decision from four candidate decisions, viz. No Migration, Data Migration Only, Cold Migration, and Live Migration. Experimental results based on a real-world scenario show that our strategy can well outperform other baseline strategies in various metrics including the flying distances and the energy consumption of UAVs.

Three UAVs picked up and dropped 23 circular and rectangular targets into a designated drop box. To control the operation of three UAVs flying over an arena of 90 x 60 m, we designed and integrated a set of technologies into our system: airspace allocation, communication framework among UAVs, anticollision based on geofencing, and a token-based prioritization for coordination. The proposed UAV system uses a single GPS and its error of a few meters is solved by means of the following component technologies: (a) flight path generator based on one reference point, (b) vision-based redefinition of a reference point for GPS correction, and (c) calibration of flight path to update the reference point. The pickup-and-drop mission is conducted via color- and shape-based vision processing and a magnetic gripper to pickup and drop-off the targets. Our proposed system is able to successfully manage three UAVs, recognize targets on the ground, and drop the targets into a drop box in the drop zone.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for this purpose due to their flexibility and lower operational costs. However, finding the most efficient paths for these UAVs remains a challenge, as it is essential to maximize victim location and minimize mission time. Methods: This study presents an autonomous UAV-based approach for identifying victims, prioritizing high-risk areas and those needing urgent medical attention. Unlike other methods focused solely on minimizing mission time, this approach emphasizes high-risk zones and potential secondary disaster areas. Using a partially observable Markov decision process, it simulates victim detection through an image classification algorithm, enabling efficient and independent operation. Results: Experiments with real data indicate that this approach reduces risk by 66% during the mission's first half while autonomously identifying victims without human intervention. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the capability of autonomous UAV systems to improve search-and-rescue efforts in disaster-prone, resource-constrained regions by effectively prioritizing high-risk areas, thereby reducing mission risk and improving response efficiency.

The non-invasive aspect of UAS and the ability to collect a large amount of high-resolution imagery should be of interest to polar bear (Ursus maritimus) researchers who face logistic challenges with field work and developing minimally invasive methods. We opportunistically observed the behavioural reactions of three adult male polar bears during UAS surveys in the summer of 2016. We recorded vigilance behaviours and compared them to previously published vigilance behaviours during wildlife-viewing activities by Dyck and Baydack (2004). The number of vigilance events was 13.4 +/- 3.7 (SE) and vigilance bout lengths was 18.7 +/- 2.6 s (SE), which is similar to reported results by Dyck and Baydack (2004). To estimate detection probabilities of polar bears from UAS imagery, we had two independent observers review mosaics and 80% of known bear locations were identified. Our preliminary results suggest that UAS are capable of detecting polar bears using RGB imagery in a relatively non-invasive manner. Before UAS can be integrated into large-scale polar bear studies, further research is required to formally assess behavioural impacts with unhabituated individuals in the wild, and model factors influencing detection probabilities.

This study was carried out in both southern and northern hospital districts of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University from May to October 2022. The main participants were the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University and Zhejiang Antwork Technology Co., Ltd. We first constructed an urban medical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery system and developed a UAV-specific storage box for COVID-19 samples. The UAV system was used to transport COVID-19 throat swab samples from the northern hospital district to the southern hospital district, and the following indexes were obtained: (1) flight time of COVID-19 samples delivered by UAV, (2) real-time temperature of COVID-19 nucleic acid samples during transportation, and (3) the time of distribution of COVID-19 nucleic acid samples by road traffic as measured using the Baidu Maps application, compared with the flight time of UAV. The COVID-19 sample delivery system for urban medical UAV mainly consists of intelligent logistics UAV, low-temperature COVID-19 throat swab sample storage box, unmanned logistics hub, and cloud operation control platform. The flight distance between the northern and southern districts of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University was 10 km, and the ground distance was 24 km. From May 11 to October 28, 2022, a total of 1,190 UAV flights occurred. The average flight time was 13 minutes, which was 40 to 70 minutes faster than the average road travel time required for manual delivery of COVID-19 throat swab samples.

One such application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Such data, acquired at high temporal and spatial resolutions, are increasingly in demand for process-oriented investigations of flow hydraulics, sediment dynamics and in-stream habitat. In these riverine environments, the most challenging region for topographic measurement is the wetted, submerged channel. Generally, dry bed topography and submerged bathymetry are measured using different methods and technology. This adds to the costs, logistical challenges and data processing requirements of comprehensive river surveys. However, some technologies are capable of measuring the submerged topography. Through-water photogrammetry and bathymetric LiDAR are capable of reasonably accurate measurements of channel beds in clear water. While the cost of bathymetric LiDAR remains high and its resolution relatively coarse, the recent developments in photogrammetry using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms promise a fundamental shift in the accessibility of topographic data for a wide range of settings. Here we present results demonstrating the potential of so called SfM-photogrammetry for quantifying both exposed and submerged fluvial topography at the mesohabitat scale. We show that imagery acquired from a rotary-winged Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) can be processed in order to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) with hyperspatial resolutions (c. 0.02m) for two different river systems over channel lengths of 50-100m. Errors in submerged areas range from 0.016m to 0.089m, which can be reduced to between 0.008m and 0.053m with the application of a simple refraction correction. This work therefore demonstrates the potential of UAS platforms and SfM-photogrammetry as a single technique for surveying fluvial topography at the mesoscale (defined as lengths of channel from c.10m to a few hundred metres).

In typical use cases, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can be applied to monitoring and logistics have received wide attention. However, subject to their own flexible maneuverability, limited computational capability, and battery energy, UAVs need to offload computation-intensive tasks to ensure the quality of service. In this paper, we solve this problem for UAV systems in a 5G heterogeneous network environment by proposing an innovative distributed framework that jointly considers transmission assessment and task offloading. Specifically, we devised a fuzzy logic-based offloading assessment mechanism at the UAV side, which can adaptively avoid risky wireless links based on the motion state of an UAV and performance transmission metrics. We introduce a multi-agent advantage actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable the UAVs to optimize the system utility by learning the best policies from the environment. This requires decisions on computing modes as well as the choices of radio access technologies (RATs) and MEC servers in the case of offloading. The results validate the convergence and applicability of our scheme. Compared with the benchmarks, the proposed scheme is superior in many aspects, such as reducing task completion delay and energy consumption.

Our approach uses monocular imagery to mimic the human ability to perceive and control a remote aircraft. This allows for the autonomous control of a wide variety of aircraft with minimal on-board sensors. We improve upon other 2D single-shot detection methods by estimating a 3D box containing the aircraft, which allows us to capture a vehicle's position and attitude as measurements. Using a constant-jerk Kalman filter, we then estimate the complete aircraft state from these measurements. Finally a proportional-integral-derivative controller is used to provide closed-loop autonomous flight of an aircraft from a remote location. Hardware experiments of a completely autonomous vehicle flying waypoints illustrate the validity of this method.

Numerous UAS and sensors are available and have been used in various methods. However, justification for selection or methods used are not typically offered in published literature. Furthermore, existing reviews do not adequately cover past and current UAS applications for animal monitoring, nor their associated UAS/sensor characteristics and environmental considerations. We present a systematic map that collects and consolidates evidence pertaining to UAS monitoring of animals.MethodsWe investigated the current state of knowledge on UAS applications in terrestrial animal monitoring by using an accurate, comprehensive, and repeatable systematic map approach. We searched relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature, as well as dissertations and theses, using online publication databases, Google Scholar, and by request through a professional network of collaborators and publicly available websites. We used a tiered approach to article exclusion with eligible studies being those that monitor (i.e., identify, count, estimate, etc.) terrestrial vertebrate animals. Extracted metadata concerning UAS, sensors, animals, methodology, and results were recorded in Microsoft Access. We queried and catalogued evidence in the final database to produce tables, figures, and geographic maps to accompany this full narrative review, answering our primary and secondary questions.Review findingsWe found 5539 articles from our literature searches of which 216 were included with extracted metadata categories in our database and narrative review. Studies exhibited exponential growth over time but have levelled off between 2019 and 2021 and were primarily conducted in North America, Australia, and Antarctica. Each metadata category had major clusters and gaps, which are described in the narrative review.ConclusionsOur systematic map provides a useful synthesis of current applications of UAS-animal related studies and identifies major knowledge clusters (well-represented subtopics that are amenable to full synthesis by a systematic review) and gaps (unreported or underrepresented topics that warrant additional primary research) that guide future research directions and UAS applications. The literature for the use of UAS to conduct animal surveys has expanded intensely since its inception in 2006 but is still in its infancy. Since 2015, technological improvements and subsequent cost reductions facilitated widespread research, often to validate UAS technology to survey single species with application of descriptive statistics over limited spatial and temporal scales. Studies since the 2015 expansion have still generally focused on large birds or mammals in open landscapes of 4 countries, but regulations, such as maximum altitude and line-of-sight limitations, remain barriers to improved animal surveys with UAS. Critical knowledge gaps include the lack of (1) best practices for using UAS to conduct standardized surveys in general, (2) best practices to survey whole wildlife communities in delineated areas, and (3) data on factors affecting bias in counting animals from UAS images. Promising advances include the use of thermal sensors in forested environments or nocturnal surveys and the development of automated or semi-automated machine-learning algorithms to accurately detect, identify, and count animals from UAS images.

Effective management of forests requires accurate, precise estimates of deer population abundance to plan and justify management actions. Spotlight surveys in combination with distance sampling are a common method of estimating deer population abundance; however, spotlight surveys are known to have serious drawbacks such as high costs and sampling biases. Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of enumerating deer from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights, conducted 1 and 6 March 2018, to develop population and density estimates in 2 United States National Parks: Harpers Ferry National Historic Park (HAFE) and Monocacy National Battlefield (MONO). Concurrent spotlight surveys at MONO enabled us to compare estimates obtained by the 2 methods. Deer density estimates by 4 observers of UAV-obtained thermal imagery from HAFE were 94.5 +/- 3.9 deer/km(2). Concurrent UAV and spotlight surveys at MONO found 19.7 +/- 0.5 deer/km(2) and 6.4 +/- 4.9 deer/km(2), respectively; suggesting that spotlight surveys may significantly underestimate deer densities. Despite the logistical challenges to UAV operation, our findings demonstrate that UAVs will become an invaluable tool for wildlife management as technology improves. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

However, field sample plot data on forest cover changes, species distribution and carbon stocks in the Miombo ecoregion are inadequate for effective forest management. Owing to logistical challenges that come with field-based inventory methods, remote sensing plays an important role in supplementing field methods to fill in data gaps. Traditional satellite and manned aircraft remote sensing platforms have their own advantages and limitations. The advent of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has made it possible to acquire forest data at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. UASs are adaptable to various forest applications in terms of providing flexibility in data acquisition with different sensors (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal and light detection and ranging (lidar)) at a convenient time. To highlight possible applications in the Miombo woodlands, we first provide an overview of the Miombo woodlands and recent progress in remote sensing with small UASs. An overview of some potential forest applications was undertaken to identify key prospects and challenges for UAS applications in the Miombo region, which will provide expertise and guidance upon which future applications in the Miombo woodlands should be based. While much of the potential of using UASs for forest data acquisition in the Miombo woodlands remains to be realized, it is likely that the next few years will see such systems being used to provide data for an ever-increasing range of forest applications.

This innovation will enable safe and timely delivery to hard-to-reach populations in a manner that significantly exceeds the capacity of current practices. Crucially, the HFW eliminates the motivations behind many delivery disruptions. These disruptions are caused by asymmetric commons dilemmas: entities with different accessibility and power race to grab shared relief goods before others. The problem we address is the operation of HFW to make safe and timely delivery of critical items such as health supplies to the hard to reach populations. This study constitutes proof of concept for the HFW system in conflict zones through a multi-objective mathematical model.

In this system, the airborne fulfillment center (AFC) remains or moves at a high altitude, and UAVs are deployed from the AFC to deliver orders to customers. Smaller airships, also known as shuttles, may be used to replenish the AFC with inventory, UAVs, fuel, supplies, and staff. Amazon's AFC delivery system is a novel and challenging system that can convert same-day deliveries into 10 min deliveries and provide a wide range of UAV delivery services for Amazon Prime members. However, to operate the AFC delivery system efficiently, a quantitative operation methodology needs to be developed, which considers the related regulations and consumable replenishment. In this study, mixed-integer linear programming is developed to derive optimal operation schedules for AFC, shuttles, and UAVs simultaneously. The proposed model can be used in real time to address system changes and derive new operation schedules. The effects of system components are analyzed via a numerical experiment to provide managerial guidelines for the implementation of the AFC delivery system. Furthermore, cooperation between the new AFC delivery system and the existing stationary UAV delivery service was investigated. The results demonstrate the possibility of complementary cooperation between the two systems. C1 [Jeong, Ho Young; Lee, Seokcheon] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.

We propose that combining bioacoustic monitoring with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology could reduce some of these biases and allow bird surveys to be conducted in less accessible areas. We tested the feasibility of the UAV approach to songbird surveys using a low-cost quadcopter with a simple, lightweight recorder suspended 8 m below the vehicle. In a field experiment using playback of bird recordings, we found that small variations in UAV altitude (it hovered at 28, 48, and 68 m) didn't have a significant effect on detections by the recorder attached to the UAV, and we found that the detection radius of our equipment was comparable with detection radii of standard point counts. We then field tested our equipment, comparing songbird detections from our UAV-mounted recorder with standard point-count data from 51 count stations. We found that the number of birds per point on UAV counts was comparable with standard counts for most species, but there were significant underestimates for some-specifically, issues of song masking for a species with a low-frequency song, the Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura); and underestimation of the abundance of a species that was found in very high densities, the Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis). Species richness was lower on UAV counts (mean = 5.6 species point(-1)) than on standard counts (8.3 species point (-1)), but only slightly lower than on standard counts if nonaudible detections are omitted (6.5 species point (-1)). Excessive UAV noise is a major hurdle to using UAVs for bioacoustic monitoring, but we are optimistic that technological innovations to reduce motor and rotor noise will significantly reduce this issue. We conclude that UAV-based bioacoustic monitoring holds great promise, and we urge other researchers to consider further experimentation to refine techniques.

It is useful to deliver cargoes by airdrops from fixed-wing UAVs. However, wind and parameter errors of the UAV could make the cargo deviate from the desired landing point. To improve the accuracy of airdrop methods, this paper presents the Continuously Computed Release Point under conditions of strong wind (SW-CCRP) airdrop strategy to transport the cargo to a given position by a fixed-wing UAV. In this strategy, a set of differential equations are used to model the cargo motion and wind perturbations are considered. Based on the established motion model and the kinematic relationships between the cargo and the target position, the expected release point can be accurately predicted in real time. In order to satisfy the precision requirement, the precision assignment is studied to determine the permissible parameter error ranges. In view of that the conventional precision assignment methods are difficult to be applied in the airdrop system because of its complexity and strong nonlinearity, an adaptive mutant particle swarm optimization (AMPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, in which the adaptive inertia weight can balance the global and local search. In addition, the mutation factor of the AMPSO is able to avoid premature convergence and stagnation. Finally, two specific test scenarios are designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

This work considers the problem of designing a smooth dynamic feedback control law for a point mass payload suspended to a quadrotor and making the load to follow a large class of curves that includes both closed and non-closed curves. Typically, the load path following problem is solved using either a coordinate-free or a local-coordinate-based approach. However, in this article, we adopt an alternative methodology. First, we express the system dynamics in an extended Euclidean space using a global coordinate system. Second, we propose two families of functions that lead to the design of almost-global and local controllers in terms of region of convergence. We cast the load path following the problem in the framework of set stabilization, and as a result, the proposed controllers make the given path an invariant manifold. The resulting controllers guarantee that once the suspended load converges to the path, it stays on the path indefinitely while satisfying other application-specific constraints. Finally, to complement the theoretical results, we provide a successful real-world experimental validation of the proposed controller on a Quanser QDrone UAV platform with a cable-suspended payload.

Drone-imagery methods can observe larger extents to estimate indicators at landscape scales with higher confidence than traditional field sampling. They also have the potential to replace field methods in some instances and enable the development of indicators not measurable from the ground. Much research has already demonstrated that several quantitative rangeland indicators can be estimated from high-resolution imagery. Developing a suite of monitoring methods that are useful for supporting management decisions (e.g., repeatable, cost-effective, and validated against field methods) will require additional exploration to develop best practices for image acquisition and analytical workflows that can efficiently estimate multiple indicators. We embedded with a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field monitoring crew in Northern California, USA to compare field-measured and imagery-derived indicator values and to evaluate the logistics of using small UAS within the framework of an existing monitoring program. The unified workflow we developed to measure fractional cover, canopy gaps, and vegetation height was specific for the sagebrush steppe, an ecosystem that is common in other BLM managed lands. The correspondence between imagery and field methods yielded encouraging agreement while revealing systematic differences between the methods. Workflow best practices for producing repeatable rangeland indicators is likely to vary by vegetation composition and phenology. An online space dedicated to sharing imagery-based workflows could spur collaboration among researchers and quicken the pace of integrating drone-imagery data within adaptive management of rangelands. Though drone-imagery methods are not likely to replace most field methods in large monitoring programs, they could be a valuable enhancement for pressing local management needs.

The problem considers same-sized packages, belonging to different weight classes. EVs serve as motherships, from which drones are deployed to deliver the packages. Drones can carry multiple packages, up to a certain weight limit and their range is depended on their payload weight.

Based on the preplanned paths, a double deep Q network (DDQN) based resource allocation method is proposed to maximize the average sum capacity of UAV-to-UAV (U2U) links and reduce transmission delay while minimizing the interference to UAV-to-infrastructure (U2I) links. Multi-UAV communication networks are reconnected according to the positions of UAVs changing in each time slot. Then each U2U link acting as an agent learns to improve spectrum and power allocation policy with imperfect knowledge of the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDQN-based resource management scheme can achieve higher system communication capacity than a random scheme. Moreover, the successful transmission probability of U2U links obtained by the DDQN-based method is much higher than a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based method.

However, mostly the reported optimizers struggle to estimate the flyable trajectories within acceptable accuracy and time bound under various constraints, particularly in a complex 3D environment. Therefore, this work proposes a novel hybrid optimizer (HCPSOA) by combining the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA). Further, the chaotic logistic map and dynamic weight adjustments have been incorporated to enhance the exploration-exploitation capabilities. After validating the promising performance of HCPSOA against popular metaheuristics (COA, PSO, Improved COA, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, and Hybrid Fireworks PSO) for several benchmark functions, the proposed HCPSOA has been employed to estimate the flyable path by formulating a novel cost function and smoothened by cubic B-spline curve. The simulated results reveal that the HCPSOA provide a non -colliding path with up to 10.00% lesser average cost for the considered real world scenario (map 3), which confirms its supremacy for the estimation of the safe and flyable relative to other compared algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The initial part in reducing losses sourced from plant diseases is to make an accurate and earlier identification. Thus, the usage of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensors for surveying and assessing crops, orchards, and forests has rapidly elevated over the last decade, particularly for the stress management like water, diseases, nutrition deficits, and pests. Using Minkowski Distance-based Fuzzy C Means (MD-FCM) clustering and Xavier initialization-adapted Cosine Similarity-induced Radial Bias Function Neural Network (XCS-RBFNN) techniques, a UAV HS imaging remote sensor for Spatial and Temporal Resolution (STR) of mango plant disease and pest identification is proposed in this scheme. Collecting the input UAV source (image or video) is eventuated initially along with the Region of Interest (ROI) calculated which is followed by preprocessing. Leaf segmentation is eventuated using Logistic U-net after preprocessing. Next, MD-FCM performs clustering to cluster the diseased leaves and pests individually. The disease and pest characteristics are then retrieved separately and classified further. The requisite features are then chosen from the retrieved features utilizing the Levy Flight Distribution-produced Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (LFD-BOA). Finally, the XCS-RBFNN classifier is utilized to categorize the various diseases together with pests found in the UAV input source using the chosen features. The proposed framework's experimental findings are then compared to some prevailing schemes, with the results revealing that the proposed work outperforms other benchmark techniques. C1 [Pansy, D.

Low cost unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can provide information on the spatial pattern of hosts' distribution and abundance, which is crucial as regards modelling the determinants of disease transmission and persistence on a fine spatial scale. In this context we have studied the spatial epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in the ungulate community of Donana National Park (South-western Spain) by modelling species host (red deer, fallow deer and cattle) abundance at fine spatial scale. The use of UAS high-resolution images has allowed us to collect data to model the environmental determinants of host abundance, and in a further step to evaluate their relationships with the spatial risk of TB throughout the ungulate community. We discuss the ecological, epidemiological and logistic conditions under which UAS may contribute to study the wildlife/livestock sanitary interface, where the spatial aggregation of hosts becomes crucial. These findings are relevant for planning and implementing research, fundamentally when managing disease in multi-host systems, and focusing on risky areas. Therefore, managers should prioritize the implementation of control strategies to reduce disease of conservation, economic and social relevance.

Aerial logistic systems, however, require a substantially different approach to operations management and need specifically designed supportive infrastructures. While the research on urban aerial delivery mostly focuses on the optimization vehicle operations, the appropriate design of supportive infrastructures is seldom considered. This paper focuses on the energy efficiency of aerial logistic systems, and proposes a new original methodology to obtain a realistic estimate of the overall energy consumed by a swarm of drones employed for urban delivery, taking into account the extension of the area served and its specific features. The methodology proposed offers relevant information for the decision problems related to the appropriate sizing of the infrastructures, the dimensioning of the swarm of drones and the capacity of the energy storage system. The paper also reports a comparison with ground vehicles in the same scenarios, showing the relevant tradeoffs. The results obtained demonstrate how an appropriate design of the supportive infrastructures for urban aerial logistics may significantly impact the overall efficiency of the delivery system.

These phenomena reduce the attractiveness of the city and result in a degradation of the quality of life for its residents. In light of these phenomena, there is a clear need for intelligent management of urban space using new technologies that would be complementary to existing intelligent transportation systems. Expanding information resources obtained from mobile cameras will have a positive impact on increasing the efficiency of transportation management and use of limited space in city centers. It will also have an impact on reducing external transport costs and increasing the quality of logistics services provided in the city. The main aim of the paper is to develop a concept of a transport management system in cities using mobile vision systems mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles. The model will concern the cases of lane occupation by freight vehicles and the analysis of parking spaces in the city in order to improve their management.

Global rules in most countries had previously limited the use of drones to military applications due to their deployment in the open air, drones are likely to be lost, destroyed, or physically hijacked. However, more recently, the presence of COVID-19 has forced the world to present new implementing measures which will also widen the use of drones in civil and commercial and social applications, especially now in the delivery of medicines for medical home care. In the period of required public isolation as a consequence of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, this knowledge has become one of the principal partners in the fight against the coronavirus. This paper offers a summary of the medical drone manufacturing, with a specific emphasis on its approval by the pharmaceutical sector to solve logistical problems in healthcare during times of sensitive need. We also discuss the numerous challenges to be met in the integration of drones to save our lives and suggest future research directions. The question that arises for this problem, how to optimize delivery medical supplies times in-home health care made up of drones? We conducted a synthesis literature review devoted to the use of UAVs in healthcare with their different aspects. A total of different research made are given to describe the role of UAV in Home healthcare with the presence of SARS-COV-2. We conclude that the drones will be able to optimize the way of eliminating contamination with a very high percentage (through the reduction of human contact) with the increase of the flexibility of the flight (reaching the less accessible regions every hour of the day).

These UAVs often rely on wireless communication networks for data transmission, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. To address these challenges, it is necessary to detect potential threats by analyzing the encrypted Wi-Fi traffic data generated by UAVs. This study aimed to develop a linear SVM model that is enhanced with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques and fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization for intrusion detection systems (IDSs); the model is specifically designed to identify malware threats targeting UAVs. This research utilized encrypted Wi-Fi traffic data derived from three different UAV networks, namely, Parrot Bebop 1, DBPower UDI, and DJI Spark, while considering unidirectional and bidirectional communication flow modes. SVM-based intrusion detection models have been modeled on these datasets, identified their key features using the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) technique, and conducted a cost analysis of the proposed modeling approach. The incorporation of the LIME method enabled to highlight the features that are highly indicative of cyberattacks and provided valuable insights into the importance of each feature in the context of intrusion detection. In conclusion, this interpretable IDS model, fine-tuned with Bayesian optimization, demonstrated its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods, proving its efficacy in detecting and mitigating threats to UAVs while offering a cost-effective solution.

Accordingly, the development of new concepts for countermeasures systems, able to identify and neutralize a single (or multiples) malicious drone(s) (i.e., classified as a threat), has become of primary importance. For this purpose, the paper evaluates the concept of a multiplatform counter-UAS system (CUS), based mainly on a team of mini drones acting as a cooperative defensive system.

In order to make these hybrid aerodromes operate safely and efficiently, the autonomous taxiing system of UAVs that adapts to the dynamic environment has now become increasingly important, particularly under poor visibility conditions. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic self-learning approach for the situation awareness of UAVs' autonomous taxiing. First, the probabilistic representation for a dynamic navigation map and camera images are developed at the pixel level to capture the taxiway markings and the other objects of interest (e.g., logistic vehicles and other aircraft). Then, we develop a self-learning approach so that the navigation map can be maintained online by continuously map-updating with the obtained camera observations via Bayesian learning. An indoor experiment was undertaken to evaluate the developed self-learning method for improved situation awareness. It shows that the developed approach is capable of improving the robustness of obstacle detection via updating the navigation map dynamically.

As observations are expensive and logistically challenging, it is important to evaluate the benefit that additional observations could bring to NWP. Atmospheric soundings applying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a large potential to supplement conventional radiosonde sounding observations. Here, we applied UAV and radiosonde sounding observations from an RV Polarstern cruise in the ice-covered Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013 to evaluate the impact of their assimilation in the Polar version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (Polar WRF) model. Our experiments revealed small to moderate impacts of radiosonde and UAV data assimilation. In any case, the assimilation of sounding data from both radiosondes and UAVs improved the analyses of air temperature, wind speed, and humidity at the observation site for most of the time. Further, the impact on the results of 5-day-long Polar WRF experiments was often felt over distances of at least 300 km from the observation site. All experiments succeeded in capturing the main features of the evolution of near-surface variables, but the effects of data assimilation varied between different cases. Due to the limited vertical extent of the UAV observations, the impact of their assimilation was limited to the lowermost 1-2-km layer, and assimilation of radiosonde data was more beneficial for modeled sea level pressure and near-surface wind speed.

This paper proposes a cooperative delivery scheme combining traditional trucks and UAVs to extend UAV coverage and improve delivery completion rates. For densely distributed depots in wide-area regions, we develop algorithms for task allocation and path planning in a truck-independent UAV system. Specifically, a minimum-cost, maximum-flow model is constructed to obtain sub-paths covering all delivery tasks, and resource tree-based algorithms are used to construct global paths for UAVs and trucks. Simulation results show that our algorithms reduce total energy consumption by 11.53% and 9.15% under different task points, which suggests that our proposed method can significantly enhance delivery efficiency, offering a promising solution for future logistics operations.

{"TI": "Trajectory Planning for Emergency Landing of VTOL Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", "AB": "In recent years, inspired by technological progress and the outstanding performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in several local wars, the UAV industry has witnessed explosive development, widely used in communication relay, logistics, surveying and mapping, patrol, surveillance, and other fields. Vertical Take-Off and Landing fixed-wing UAV has both the advantages of vertical take-off and landing of rotorcraft and the advantages of long endurance of fixed-wing UAV, which broadened its application field and is the most popular UAV at present. Recently, fixed-wing UAV failure analysis highlights that cruise engine shutdown is the most common reason for emergency landing, which is also a governing factor for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) fixed-wing UAV failures. Nevertheless, the emergency landing trajectory of the latter UAV type after engine shutdown is different from that of the conventional fixed-wing UAVs due to the VTOL power system. Hence, spurred by the requirement of a safe emergency landing trajectory for VTOL fixed-wing UAVs, this paper develops an architecture capable of safe emergency landing for such platforms. The suggested method develops a particle dynamics model of the VTOL UAV and analyzes its aerodynamic characteristics utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. The UAV's trajectory is divided into three parts for enhanced planning. For the guidance stage, the initial position and heading angle are arbitrary. Hence, the Dubins shortest cross-range and the fastest descent trajectory are adopted to steer the UAV above the landing window quickly. The spiral stage comprises a conical and cylindrical part combined with a spiral descent trajectory of variable radius for energy management and landing course alignment. Given the limited energy storage of VTOL power systems, the landing stage exploits an optimal control trajectory problem solved by a Gaussian pseudospectral method, involving trajectory conventional landing planning, unpowered landing, distance optimal landing, and wind-resistant landing. All trajectories meet the dynamics constraints, terminal constraints, and sliding performance constraints and cover both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional trajectories. A large number of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed trajectories manage broad applicability and strong feasibility for VTOL fixed-wing UAVs.

To study the effects of climate change on vegetation, there is a need for knowledge on its current status and properties. Both classic field observation methods and remote sensing methods based on manned aircraft or satellite image analysis have limitations. These include high logistic operation costs, limited research areas, high safety risks, direct human impact, and insufficient resolution of satellite images. Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle beyond the visual line of sight (UAV BVLOS) missions can bridge the scale gap between field-based observations and full-scale airborne or satellite surveys. In this study the two operations of the UAV BVLOS, at an altitude of 350 m ASL, have been successfully performed in Antarctic conditions. Maps of the vegetation of the western shore of Admiralty Bay (King George Island, South Shetlands, Western Antarctic) that included the Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 128 (ASPA 128) were designed. The vegetation in the 7.5 km(2) area was mapped in ultra-high resolution (<5 cm and DEM of 0.25 m GSD), and from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), four broad vegetation units were extracted: \"dense moss carpets\" (covering 0.14 km(2), 0.8% of ASPA 128), \"Sanionia uncinata moss bed\" (0.31 km(2), 1.7% of ASPA 128), \"Deschampsia antarctica grass meadow\" (0.24 km(2), 1.3% of ASPA 128), and \"Deschampsia antarctica-Usnea antarctica heath\" (1.66 km(2), 9.4% of ASPA 128). Our results demonstrate that the presented UAV BVLOS-based surveys are time-effective (single flight lasting 2.5 h on a distance of 300 km) and cost-effective when compared to classical field-based observations and are less invasive for the ecosystem. Moreover, unmanned airborne vehicles significantly improve security, which is of particular interest in polar region research. Therefore, their development is highly recommended for monitoring areas in remote and fragile environments.

This work is motivated by a real application, where the company Connect Robotics, the first drone delivery provider in Portugal, made a partnership with a pharmacy located at a rural region to start implementing the delivery of medicines by drone. The pharmacy receives orders throughout the day and has to deliver in the same day with tight lead-times. The resulting problem is modelled as a Dynamic Parallel Drone Scheduling Vehicle Routing Problem with Lead-Time. A solution method is devised to solve it, thus helping the pharmacist to plan the car and drone delivery routes during the day. The results obtained on real instances revealed that the solution method is effective when compared to the optimal solutions of the static version of the problem, since the dynamic solution only differs, on average, about 7% from the static one. Moreover, some managerial insights about the impact of adding drones to the distribution operation are discussed, namely the economic and environmental impacts with cost savings up to 41% and reduction of monthly CO2 emissions of 310 kg, the use of spare batteries which increase the benefit from 16% to 41%, and same-day versus next-day delivery.

Species differences in the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation can be used as a surrogate estimate plant biodiversity using multispectral image data. However, these efforts are often hampered by logistical difficulties in broad-scale implementation. Here, we investigate the utility of multispectral imaging technology from commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) in estimating biodiversity metrics at a fine spatial resolution (0.1-0.5 cm pixel resolution) in a temperate calcareous grassland in Oxfordshire, UK. We calculate a suite of moments (coefficient of variation, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) for the distribution of radiance from multispectral images at five wavelength bands (Blue 450 +/- 16 nm; Green 560 +/- 16 nm; Red 650 +/- 16 nm; Red Edge 730 +/- 16 nm; Near Infrared 840 +/- 16 nm) and test their effectiveness at estimating ground-truthed biodiversity metrics from in situ botanical surveys for 37-1 x 1 m quadrats. We find positive associations between the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance and both the Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's biodiversity indices. Furthermore, the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance is consistent and highly repeatable across sampling days and recording heights. Positive associations with biodiversity indices hold irrespective of the image recording height (2-8 m), but we report reductions in estimates of spectral diversity with increases to UAV recording height. UAV imaging reduced sampling time by a factor of 16 relative to in situ botanical surveys. We demonstrate the utility of multispectral radiance moments as an indicator of biodiversity in this temperate calcareous grassland at a fine spatial resolution using a widely available UAV monitoring system with a coarse spectral resolution. The use of UAV technology with multispectral sensors has far-reaching potential to provide cost-effective and high-resolution monitoring of biodiversity.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts of drone versus motorcycle delivery and to compare the expected environmental improvements due to drone delivery in urban and rural areas. In addition, the potential environmental contributions of electric motorcycles were assessed to determine the effects of introducing this new type of vehicle. Changes in the national electricity generation plan were also examined. The results showed that global warming potential (GWP) per 1 km delivery by drone was one-sixth that of motorcycle delivery, and the particulates produced by drone delivery were half that of motorcycle delivery.

Extensive literature is used to explain the ground transportation difficulties following a disaster and some possible alternative choices. Due to roads blockage and time limits in the disaster response phase, small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopter can be utilized as relief distributors. The use of UAV helicopters for humanitarian purposes and even for commercial purposes by some companies has been discussed in several publications. Yet no one has considered an autonomous small UAV helicopter network for post-earthquake relief distribution in highly populated cities. In an applied sense, the study offers a system that helps earthquake response managers in the early hours following an earthquake. The suggested system is a synthesis of many new technical results achieved in the area of earthquake detection, data fusion, and UAV helicopters. The relief distribution system by medium-scale UAV helicopters is investigated in Tehran metropolis as a case study for the worst-case earthquake scenario. The outcomes reveal that the system has efficient capability for urban areas with high population density. The proposed aerial distribution system can supply a large amount of demand in a small amount of time. Moreover, it works without disturbing the ground transportation system and may turn out to be managed as a complementary system for serving the affected people in non-accessible areas.

Their use in indoor environments requires a precise perception of the surrounding area, immediate response to its changes, and, consequently, a robust position estimation. This paper provides an implementation of navigation algorithms for solving the problem of fast, reliable, and low-cost inventorying in the logistics industry. The drone localization is achieved with a particle filter algorithm that uses an array of distance sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. Navigation is based on a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) position controller that ensures an obstacle-free path within the known 3D map. As for the full 3D coverage, an extraction of the targets and then their final succession towards optimal coverage is performed. Finally, a series of experiments are carried out to examine the robustness of the positioning system using different motion patterns and velocities. At the same time, various ways of traversing the environment are examined by using different configurations of the sensor that is used to perform the area coverage.

Here we present a method for surveying population health that uses UAVs to sample respiratory vapor, 'whale blow', exhaled by free-swimming humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and coupled this with amplification and sequencing of respiratory tract microbiota. We developed a low-cost multirotor UAV incorporating a sterile petri dish with a remotely operated 'blow' to sample whale blow with minimal disturbance to the whales. This design addressed several sampling challenges: accessibility; safety; cost, and critically, minimized the collection of atmospheric and seawater microbiota and other potential sources of sample contamination. We collected 59 samples of blow from northward migrating humpback whales off Sydney, Australia and used high throughput sequencing of bacterial ribosomal gene markers to identify putative respiratory tract microbiota. Model-based comparisons with seawater and drone-captured air demonstrated that our system minimized external sources of contamination and successfully captured sufficient material to identify whale blow-specific microbial taxa. Whale-specific taxa included species and genera previously associated with the respiratory tracts or oral cavities of mammals (e.g., Pseudomonas, Clostridia, Cardiobacterium), as well as species previously isolated from dolphin or killer whale blowholes (Corynebacteria, others). Many examples of exogenous marine species were identified, including Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. that have been associated with the skin microbiota of marine mammals and fish and may include pathogens. This information provides a baseline of respiratory tract microbiota profiles of contemporary whale health. Customized UAVs are a promising new tool for marine megafauna research and may have broad application in cost-effective monitoring and management of whale populations worldwide.

The UAV takes off from the depot, completes the pickup and delivery tasks, and returns to the depot; it needs to maintain a reliable connection with the ground base station (GBS) during the UAV's flight. In the mission, the energy consumption of the UAV is closely related to the order of pickup and delivery as well as the weight of the goods. Therefore, this paper achieves the goal of minimizing UAV energy consumption and designing UAV flight trajectory by optimizing the access sequence. In this paper, we first construct a radio map of the target area, and then we propose an improved Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the path which is the shortest between any two access points that satisfies reliable communication. Then, using the constructed distance matrix, we use a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to solve the UAV trajectory of the minimum energy pickup and delivery problem (PDP). Finally, through the simulation analysis of traditional PDP and energy-efficient PDP on the python platform, it can be found that our proposed minimum energy consumption PDP saves about 20% of energy consumption compared with the traditional PDP without considering energy consumption.

{"TI": "Development of a UAV-Based Gamma Spectrometry System for Natural Radionuclides and Field Tests at Central Asian Uranium Legacy Sites", "DE": "unmanned aerial vehicles; gamma spectrometry; uranium legacy sites; radiation risk assessment; institutional control; long-term monitoring", "AB": "Uranium mining and processing had been widespread in Central Asia since the mid-1940s. However, with the establishment of the newly independent states in the 1990s, many of the former uranium mining and processing facilities and their associated wastes (dumps and tailings) were abandoned and have since posed a threat to the environment. The fact that the sites were left behind without proper remediation for a long time has led to the uncontrolled spread of radioactive and toxic contaminants in the environment due to landslides or flooding. Knowledge of the exact location of some waste facilities was lost as a result of social disruptions during the 1990s. In order to assess radiological risks and plan and implement adequate, sustainable, and environmental remediation measures, the radiological situation at the uranium legacy sites must be repeatedly mapped with the best possible accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this paper, we present the experimental use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with gamma spectrometry systems as a novel tool for mapping, assessing, and monitoring radioactivity at sites affected by uranium mining and processing and other activities related to enhanced natural radioactivity. Special emphasis is put on the practical conditions of using UAV-based gamma spectrometry in an international context focusing on low- and medium-income countries. Challenges and opportunities of this technology are discussed, and its reliability and robustness under field conditions are critically reviewed. The most promising future application of the technology appears to be the radiological monitoring, institutional control, and quality assurance of legacy sites during and after environmental remediation. One-off administrative and logistical challenges of the technology are outweighed by the significant amount of time and cost saved once a UAV-based gamma spectrometry survey system is set up.

However, it is witnessing sporadic and steady growth due to booming demands, technological advancement, and regulatory support. The intelligence and integrity of UAV systems depend largely on the underlying cognitive and cybersecurity models, which serve as both eyes and brains to perceive and respond to the myriad of scenarios around them. Smart mobility and intelligent logistic ecosystems (SMiLE) are complex and advanced technological networks which are exposed to several issues. The incorporation of UAVs for priority logistics, thereby extending the coverage and capacity of SMiLE, further heightens these vulnerabilities and questions its security, safety, and sustainability. This review scrutinizes the significant security disruptions, smartness dynamics, and sundry developments for the sustainable deployment of UAVs as an aerial logistics-based vehicle. Using the PRISMA-SPIDER methodology, 157 articles were selected for quantitative analysis and 20 review articles for qualitative evaluation. Security and safety issues in UAVs cut across all the layers of logistics operations: components, communication, network architecture, navigation, supply chain etc. Expanding the capacity of SMiLE using UAV demands an intentional and incremental convergence-based integration of an agile explainable artificial framework for reliable and safety-conscious smart mobility, a scalable and tamperproof blockchain for multi-factor authentication, and a zero trust cybersecurity paradigm for inclusive enterprise-based authorization.

Four remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) were fielded in Minamisanriku and Rikuzentakata from April 18 to 24, 2011, for port clearing and victim recovery missions using sonar and video. The ROVs were used for multirobot operations only 46% of the time due to logistics. The teleoperated ROVs functioned as a dependent team 86% of the time to avoid sensor interference or collisions. The deployment successfully reopened the Minamisanriku New Port area and searched areas prohibited to divers in Rikuzentakata. The IRS-CRASAR team planned to return from October 18 to 28, 2011, with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and an ROV to conduct debris mapping for environmental remediation missions. The intent was to investigate an interdependent strategy by which the UAV and AUV would rapidly conduct low-resolution scans identifying areas of interest for further investigation by the ROV. The UAV and AUV could not be used; however, the ROV was able to cover 80,000 m2 in 6 h, finding submerged wreckage and pollutants in areas previously marked clear by divers. The field work (i) showed that the actual and planned multirobot system configurations did not fall neatly into traditional taxonomies, (ii) identified a new measure, namely perceptual confidence, and (iii) posed five open research questions for multirobot systems operating in littoral regions.

{"TI": "Adaptive Control Design for Multi-UAV Cooperative Lift Systems", "AB": "Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative lift systems use multiple UAVs to collectively lift and transport payloads. These systems have unique benefits over standard single-vehicle logistics paradigms in that they distribute lift capacity among several potentially inexpensive and man-portable aircraft, and furthermore provide redundancy to guard against vehicle failure. However, several challenges arise when multiple vehicles are tasked with coordinating stabilization and control tasks for an unknown payload, particularly when there is also uncertainty regarding relative vehicle placement and orientation. This paper presents a novel adaptive control framework for modular cooperative lift systems. The algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter to update system parameters within a control allocation scheme. Thrust vectoring is employed to ensure adequate yaw control authority, and null-space excitation is used to speed estimator convergence. The adaptive control approach is designed to execute a full payload transportation mission starting from rest on the ground. Extensive simulation studies and preliminary flight experiments evaluate robustness of the adaptive control scheme and explore tradeoffs with respect to several system parameters and levels of uncertainty. Overall, the proposed control and estimator scheme is shown to be highly effective in stabilizing multi-UAV payload systems under realistic uncertainty in vehicle configuration and payload parameters.

{"TI": "An unmanned aerial vehicle sampling platform for atmospheric water vapor isotopes in polar environments", "AB": "Above polar ice sheets, atmospheric water vapor exchange occurs across the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and is an important mechanism in a number of processes that affect the surface mass balance of the ice sheets. Yet, this exchange is not well understood and has substantial implications for modeling and remote sensing of the polar hydrologic cycle. Efforts to characterize the exchange face substantial logistical challenges including the remoteness of ice sheet field camps, extreme weather conditions, low humidity and temperature that limit the effectiveness of instruments, and dangers associated with flying manned aircraft at low altitudes. Here, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sampling platform for operation in extreme polar environments that is capable of sampling atmospheric water vapor for subsequent measurement of water isotopes. This system was deployed to the East Greenland Ice-core Project (East-GRIP) camp in northeast Greenland during summer 2019. Four sampling flight missions were completed. With a suite of atmospheric measurements aboard the UAV (temperature, humidity, pressure, GPS) we determine the height of the PBL using online algorithms, allowing for strategic decision-making by the pilot to sample water isotopes above and below the PBL. Water isotope data were measured by a Picarro L2130-i instrument using flasks of atmospheric air collected within the nose cone of the UAV. The internal repeatability for delta D and delta O-18 was 2.8 parts per thousand and 0.45 parts per thousand, respectively, which we also compared to independent EastGRIP tower-isotope data. Based on these results, we demonstrate the efficacy of this new UAV-isotope platform and present improvements to be utilized in future polar field campaigns. The system is also designed to be readily adaptable to other fields of study, such as measurement of carbon cycle gases or remote sensing of ground conditions.

The control strategy has been extensively tested with different trajectories: linear, helical, circular, and even a lemniscate one. During the experiments, the mass of the UAV is triplicated and winds of 6 and 9 in Beaufort's scale are introduced. Simulation results show how the online learning of the estimator increases the robustness of the controller, reducing the effects of the changes in the mass and of the wind on the quadrotor.

Here, we tested photogrammetry methods using small aerial drones for accurate morphometric measurements of Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) body size and body condition. We flew drones to collect aerial imagery of captive manatees in Quintana Roo, Mexico and compared manatee body size measurements from scaled aerial imagery with physically measured body sizes. To assess optimal altitude for imaging, body size measurements acquired with an out-of-the-box drone were compared to measurements from the same drone model equipped with a LiDAR for precision altimetry flown at three altitudes (30 m, 50 m, 70 m). The accuracy of body size measures was similar for all drone models but improved with the addition of LiDAR. Difference in body size estimates between manual and drone-based measurements indicate a correction factor may be needed to account for disparities. We then used body size measurements to develop a body condition index for Antillean manatees. Our findings highlight the strength of low-cost aerial drones for morphometric measurements and assessments of manatee body condition.

A new \"multi -type of UAV collaborative delivery\" mode has been proposed. Through a combination of large, medium and small UAVs, the delivery capabilities of the UAV logistics system are significantly improved. Sometimes there is high demand, resulting in planned delivery routes that are no longer feasible, and even cause a shortage of distribution centre capacity and drones. This study explores logistics delivery strategies to solve problems caused by high demand. In this study, a multitype and multidistribution UAV model was established with the objective of minimising the total cost of distribution by considering factors such as the UAV energy consumption, load and distribution centre conditions. An improved ant colony algorithm was designed and its effectiveness was verified through the variability of the calculation time and multiple calculation results of different -scale examples. Finally, the classic vehicle routing problem (VRP) case is used in three scenarios to analyse the UAV scheduling optimisation problem. The results indicate that assisted delivery can reduce costs by 3% while ensuring delivery timeliness. The results of this study can provide guidance and benchmarks for the application of UAVs in urban logistics delivery systems.

One conceivable scenario is to use the drone to transfer jobs in a robotic mobile fulfillment center. Each job might be characterized by origin, destination, time window, and precedence relation. In particular, a take-away conveyor is continuously pushing forward shipping cartons, wherein drones must pick up jobs and drop them off to the cartons within the time window since the cartons would be closed and labeled at the end of the conveyor. Furthermore, each job contains two subtransfers for drone: flight from drone's current location to pickup location and flight to dropoff location. Two exact approaches are proposed-a mixed integer programming and a constraint programming-and tested for a real-time perspective. Note to Practitioners-Inspired by Amazon's significant expansion of its army of warehouse robots and the adaptation of drones for final-mile small parcel delivery, this article has mixed those two emerging technologies and proposed a drone-powered material transfer system in a warehouse, wherein jobs would be picked up by drone, transferred, and dropped off directly to shipping cartons.

The regulatory agencies, numerous States and entities are involved in creation of the safe integration with manned aviation. The so-called U-space concept announced by the European Commission is one of the approaches to achieve that goal. There is also known concept of Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) - a tool which would enable the services needed for safe conduct of UAV flights in generally accessible airspace. There are quite a few European projects which focuses on testing UTM capabilities in order to find a solution which could enable the market and ensure safe UAV operations. One of those systems is PansaUTM - which was developed in order to coordinate drone flights in different types of airspace in Poland. The first part of the paper will present an example of the implementation of this system as a foundation for new possible applications of drones and increasing number of operations. The conclusion of the first part of the article is that, in line rapid growth of UAS flights and different applications of drone services, the European drone ecosystem should evolve even further to deploy very complex drone operations in scalable manner. In order to accommodate unmanned air taxi operations, cargo flights, medical cargo flights, automatic surveillance flights, etc. Europe is preparing towards deployment of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). The second part of the text indicate the possibility of extensive use of drones in medical logistics as well as minimizing the epidemiological risk as a result of the use of this mean of transport. At the same time, it should be stressed out that the medical transport using drones can be used in urgent situations, where the main variable that has an impact on the success of life and health saving is the breaking of barriers to reaching difficult-to-reach places. In addition, the development of transport using drones can have a lasting impact on improving the quality of life of chronically ill patients who experience severe disease recurrence and thus on the need to implement emergency prevention or treatment measures. The second part of the article focuses as well on the U-space concept as an opportunity for UAVs to be widely used in the field of day-to-day supplies as well as health-related supplies. In the context of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, drones may be used to provide diagnostic screening tests, medicinal products and septic materials, transport of samples of biological material, as well as an information campaign on how to deal with an epidemic, quarantine or isolation at home. The use of UAV for medical supplies is economically and legally justified. The U-space environment from the operational and regulatory side is a multidisciplinary approach that requires the interaction of aviation, law, medicine, robotics, mechatronics and engineering experts. The legal framework for the development of U-space should be taken into account, as well as sector-specific regulations taking into account the principles of the use of drones in strictly defined areas, including in the process of medical supply, and liability for damage caused by UAV medical supply or AI-controlled intelligent machines.

The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models for UAV-routing and UAV-route scheduling problems are proposed considering the effect of incidental processes and the varying payload on travel time. A hybrid genetic and simulated annealing (HGSA) algorithm is proposed for the UAV-routing problem to minimize travel time. In HGSA, genetic algorithm (GA) employs a novel stochastic crossover operator to search for the optimal global position of customers, whereas simulated annealing (SA) utilizes local search operators to avoid the local optima. A UAV-Oriented MinMin (UO-MinMin) algorithm is also proposed to minimize the makespan of the UAV-route scheduling problem. It employs a UAV-oriented view to generate the route -scheduling order with minimal computational efforts without affecting the quality of the makespan. A Monte Carlo simulation-based sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of the hybridization probability of GA and SA in the proposed HGSA algorithm. To assess the performance of the HGSA algorithm, a set P of 24 benchmark instances is adopted and adjusted to meet the constraints of the UAV-Assisted delivery system. The proposed HGSA outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization & Simulated Annealing algorithm (PSO-SA), Differential Evolution & Simulated Annealing (DE-SA), and Harris-hawks optimization (HHO). For all 24 instances, the aerial routes generated by HGSA have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the UO-MinMin algorithm for different numbers of UAVs.

However, the target movement is unpredictable in an uncertain environment, and multiple UAVs are affected by obstacles or inaccessible regions, resulting in the decreased surveillance performance and even the loss of the target. This article is dedicated to determine the current surveillance environment through the 2-D laser scanner. At the cost of the energy consumption and the transmission unreliability, a multi-UAV cooperative path optimization (MCPO) model is designed to adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which improves the target surveillance performance. Specifically, for different types of obstacles or inaccessible regions, we present a novel obstacle-avoidance selection strategy with two mechanisms in mind: 1) when some of UAVs encounter obstacles, but others can accurately monitor the target, a strict constraint mechanism is established to promptly adjust the surveillance location of each UAV, which ensures the accuracy of formation surveillance and 2) when all UAVs have to avoid obstacles, a fuzzy constraint mechanism is presented and combined with Lucas-Kanade (LK) method to expand the search range of the multi-UAV and enhance the flexible adjustment capability of the formation. To verify the superiority of the proposed optimization method, we develop a 3-D simulation experiment environment based on the UE4 platform and design several groups of experiments to analyze the effectiveness of MCPO. The experimental results demonstrate that MCPO can not only maintain the flight stability of multiple UAVs but also has satisfactory formation flexibility and surveillance accuracy.

This is because fewer commands need to be mapped into multiple controls. For our anticipated biomedical sensor for breath analysis, it is mandatory to provide medication to the patients on an urgent basis. To address this increasingly tense situation in terms of emergencies, we plan to design an unmanned vehicle that can aid spontaneously to monitor the person's health, and help the physician spontaneously during the rescue mission. Simultaneously, that must be done in such a computationally efficient algorithm that the minimum amount of energy resources are consumed. For this purpose, we resort to an unmanned logistic air-vehicle which flies from the medical centre to the affected person. After obtaining restricted permission from the regional administration, numerous challenges are identified for this design. The device is able to lift a weight of 2 kg successfully which is required for most emergency medications, while choosing the smallest distance to the destination with the GPS. By recording the movement of the vehicle in numerous directions, the results deviate to a maximum of 2% from theoretical investigations. In this way, our biomedical sensor provides critical information to the physician, who is able to provide medication to the patient urgently. On account of reasonable supply of medicines to the destination in terms of weight and time, this experimentation has been rendered satisfactory by the relevant physicians in the vicinity.

Employing a novel text mining approach, qualitative assessments, and temporal trend analysis, we examine a dataset encompassing 5364 papers from Scopus spanning the years 1978 to 2023. By employing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we identify ten distinct research topics within the domain. Our findings suggest four promising future research directions: (1) fostering sustainable SCs through innovative drone-based solutions, (2) harnessing emerging technologies to achieve global scalability within drone-based SCs, (3) exploring the applications of drone-based supply chains in pandemic control efforts, and (4) integrating drone-based logistics with multimodal transportation for efficient traffic management.

Nevertheless, the existing research on logistics UAV path planning lacks to simultaneously consider the UAV energy consumption constraints, the customer time windows, the impacts of wind speed and direction. This omission renders the existing models inappropriate for real-world transportation systems. Besides, the UAVs are still constrained by the limited payload and battery due to the highly automatic delivery process. Consequently, we investigate the effect of wind speed and direction on UAV flight states, establishes pertinent parameters and their resolution methods impacted by wind conditions, and delves into the logistics UAV path planning issue that concurrently considers the UAV energy consumption constraints, the customer time windows, and the impact of wind conditions. To resolve the proposed trajectory optimization issue, the large-scale neighborhood search algorithm (LNS) is amalgamated with the genetic algorithm (GA), forming the GA-LNS, to address the static problem, while dynamic planning concepts are employed in the decoding process of GA-LNS to solve the dynamic trajectory optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the devised algorithms yield superior solutions within a plausible timeframe, reducing distribution costs by approximately 9% in comparison to the conventional GA. Unlike the no-wind and static scenarios, path planning that incorporates dynamic wind conditions circumvents issues related to energy constraints and customer satisfaction bias evident in the prior cases. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can provide a high-efficiency, low-energy-consumption, and low-delay UAV planning strategy in the scenario of UAV-assisted data collection.

To validate this method for surveying colonial waterbirds in logistically challenging areas, we compared counts from images collected with a fixed-wing UAV to ground counts using a marked-subsample method or direct counts at three study sites: 1) in an open field using decoys that represented three colonial waterbird species; 2) constructed platforms in a swamp with colonial nesting Great Egrets (Ardea alba); and 3) an island with a large nesting colony of Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis). Estimates or direct counts from UAV images were not significantly different from a known number of decoys or ground counts for Great Egrets but were almost twice as high compared to ground counts for juvenile Brown Pelicans. UAV flights did not cause either Great Egrets or Brown Pelicans to flush from nesting areas while ground surveys flushed the majority of adult Brown Pelicans from the survey area. UAV surveys captured images of eggs in nests that could not be observed by ground surveyors. Our results indicate that UAVs can provide a cost-effective and efficient method of surveying waterbirds with similar or improved results and little disturbance of colonies compared to ground counts.

The factors listed are significant as they are hindering the incorporation of this new technology into the humanitarian supply chain, thus creating inefficiencies in the humanitarian logistics sector. Design/methodology/approach This research is approached using a two-step process. In the first step, the particular barriers for UAV implementation are determined by a literature review and consultation with experts. Next, the proposed framework, a combination of grey-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (grey-DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP), i.e. g-DANP, is used to determine a hierarchical structure for the factors and sub-factors. The grey hypothesis provides sufficient analytical data to an otherwise lacking DEMATEL technique. Also, the use of ANP gives weightage to each factor, allowing us to categorize their importance further. Findings This study reveals that factors like expensive commercial solutions and high transport energy costs are significant factors of the \"cause\" group, whereas the uncertain cost for maintenance and repair and deficiency of high-level computing are crucial factors of the \"effect\" category. The mentioned factors, along with many others, are the main reasons for the delayed incorporation of UAVs in humanitarian logistics. Practical implications The results of this study present insights for humanitarian supply chain managers, UAV producers and policymakers. Those in the humanitarian logistics sector can use the findings of this study to plan for various challenges faced as they try and implement UAVs in their supply chain. Originality/value This research is unique as it analyses the general factors hindering the implementation of UAVs in Indian humanitarian logistics. The study enriches existing literature by providing an analytic approach to determine the weightage of various interrelations between the identified factors affecting UAV incorporation in the humanitarian supply chain.

DT allows UAVs to imitate the status of physical entities in a virtual space for service provisions in the physical space. However, traditional DT solutions are challenging to accurately imitate and derive highly dynamic physical entities due to the limited computing resources of UAVs. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative DT framework to achieve a highly accurate and low-latency DT performance with a double-scale spatial DT manner. We first propose a UAV-based cooperative sensing algorithm to implement comprehensive data collection for building accurate small-scale spatial DT models. Then we propose an adaptive model parameter adjustment algorithm to improve the DT accuracy. Considering the high mobility of physical entities, we propose a model transfer algorithm to achieve a low-latency service provision. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework using a case study of UAV-based multi-target tracking. The experiment results show that our solution achieves an accurate DT with a successful tracking ratio of up to 95 percent with a low system latency of under 1 second compared to traditional DT manners on average, respectively.

For geohazard assessment, the variations of these properties might be detected by a wide range of non-intrusive techniques, which can sometimes be confusing due to their significant variation in accuracy, suitability, coverage area, logistics, timescale, cost, and integration potential; this paper reviews common geophysical methods (GM) categorized as Emitted Seismic and Ambient Noise based and proposes an integrated approach between them for improving landslide studies; this level of integration (among themselves) is an important step ahead of integrating geophysical data with remote sensing data. The aforementioned GMs help to construct a framework based on physical properties that may be linked with site characterization (e.g., a landslide and its subsurface channel geometry, recharge pathways, rock fragments, mass flow rate, etc.) and dynamics (e.g., quantification of the rheology, saturation, fracture process, toe erosion, mass flow rate, deformation marks and spatiotemporally dependent geogenic pore-water pressure feedback through a joint analysis of geophysical time series, displacement and hydrometeorological measurements from the ground, air and space). A review of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based photogrammetry for the investigation of landslides was also conducted to highlight the latest advancement and discuss the synergy between UAV and geophysical in four possible broader areas: (i) survey planning, (ii) LS investigation, (iii) LS dynamics and (iv) presentation of results in GIS environment. Additionally, endogenous source mechanisms lead to the appearance of deformation marks on the surface and provide ground for the integrated use of UAV and geophysical monitoring for landslide early warning systems. Further development in this area requires UAVs to adopt more multispectral and other advanced sensors where their data are integrated with the geophysical one as well as the climatic data to enable Artificial Intelligent based prediction of LS.

The increasing availability of high-resolution topography data generated by low-cost Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and modern photogrammetry offer an opportunity to identify and characterize these features. In this paper, we assessed the capabilities of UAS-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, coupled with a river terrace detection algorithm for mapping of river terraces over a 1.9 km(2) valley of complex terrain setting, with a focus on the performance of this latest technology over such complex terrains. With the proposed image acquisition approach and SfM photogrammetry, we constructed a 3.8 cm resolution orthomosaic and digital surface model (DSM). The vertical accuracy of DSM was assessed against 196 independent checkpoints measured with a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS. The results indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 3.1cm and 2.9 cm, respectively. These encouraging results suggest that this low-cost, logistically simple method can deliver high-quality terrain datasets even in the complex terrain, competitive with those obtained using more expensive laser scanning. A simple algorithm was then employed to detect river terraces from the generated DSM. The results showed that three levels of river terraces and a high-level floodplain were identified. Most of the detected river terraces were confirmed by field observations. Despite the highly erosive nature of fluvial systems, this work obtained good results, allowing fast analysis of fluvial valleys and their comparison. Overall, our results demonstrated that the low-cost UAS-based SfM technique could yield highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution topography data over complex terrain settings, making it particularly suitable for quick and cost-effective mapping of micro to medium-sized geomorphic features under such terrains in remote or poorly accessible areas. Methods discussed in this paper can also be applied to produce highly accurate digital terrain data over large spatial extents for some other places of complex terrains.

However, UAV-based delivery services are limited by several binding factors, such as low battery capacities and short delivery range, which in turn require simultaneous use of a large fleet for commercial scale operations. In such cases, congestion in low-altitude air will inevitably arise. This paper investigates self-organized UAV traffic flow in low altitude 3D airspace, and formulates the user equilibrium condition as a set of partial differential equations. We propose a finite element scheme to numerically solve the traffic equilibrium and compute system performance. Two specific test scenarios for last-mile freight delivery systems are studied, including one with a conventional ground-based distribution facility, and the other with a novel concept of airborne fulfillment center. We evaluate the operational cost and energy consumption of these systems under a variety of system configurations.

A customized solution algorithm is then developed, using a physics-informed neural network framework and various enhancement techniques, to efficiently solve the PDEs. The PDE solution is then used to evaluate the operational cost of a truck- drone delivery system, through a dimensionless surrogate model, which further provides the basis for optimizing several service design decisions, such as truck speed, truck routing plan and delivery headway.

To advance this goal, a lightweight, compact, and retrofit capable ignition source is critical. Compared to standard spark igniters and noncatalytic glow plugs, the use of catalytic glow plugs will provide benefits of lower required compression ratio, improved igniter life, reduced electrical energy requirements, and overall reduction in system weight and size. Experimental testing demonstrated a significant increase in surface temperature (160+degrees C) with impingement of a fuel spray compared to a conventional glow plug with engine testing demonstrating the use of catalyst allows stable engine operation at reduced power requirements. Computational analysis was performed to provide insight into the catalyst behavior. Analytical studies suggested increased stability due to both heat release due to exothermic catalytic reaction and production of reactive species. This technology would allow high power density engines to use heavy fuels, while potentially reducing electric power supply and engine complexity and weight, both of which would allow greater range and/or payload capacity. This paper discusses the feasibility of advanced igniters technology as an enabling component for the use of heavy fuels in small, high power density internal combustion engines.

Roads which are closed or opened during a disaster are considered allowing a dynamic adaptation to real world conditions and a comprehensive analysis over a rolling time-horizon. A mixed-integer problem formulation, an agent-based simulation, a heuristic-based scheduling and routing procedure as well as a Tabu Search metaheuristic are applied to analyze the given decision problem. Coordination between private and relief organization shows to be especially beneficial if time-losses resulting from closed roads are high and substantial unexpected demand occurs. Furthermore, results highlight the importance of selecting suitable transfer points and the potential of simulation and optimization based DSSs to improve disaster relief distribution.

Modeling and predicting the biomass and yield of individual plants at the farm scale represents a major challenge in precision agriculture, particularly when salinity and other abiotic stresses may play a role. Here, we evaluate a diversity panel of the wild tomato species (Solanum pimpinellifolium) through both field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based phenotyping of 600 control and 600 salt-treated plants. The study objective was to predict fresh shoot mass, tomato fruit numbers, and yield mass at harvest based on a range of variables derived from the UAV imagery. UAV-based red-green-blue (RGB) imageries collected 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks before harvest were also used to determine if prediction accuracies varied between control and salt-treated plants. Multispectral UAV-based imagery was also collected 1 and 2 weeks prior to harvest to further explore predictive insights. In order to estimate the end of season biomass and yield, a random forest machine learning approach was implemented using UAV-imagery-derived predictors as input variables. Shape features derived from the UAV, such as plant area, border length, width, and length, were found to have the highest importance in the predictions, followed by vegetation indices and the entropy texture measure. The multispectral UAV imagery collected 2 weeks prior to harvest produced the highest explained variances for fresh shoot mass (87.95%), fruit numbers (63.88%), and yield mass per plant (66.51%). The RGB UAV imagery produced very similar results to those of the multispectral UAV dataset, with the explained variance reducing as a function of increasing time to harvest. The results showed that predicting the yield of salt-stressed plants produced higher accuracies when the models excluded control plants, whereas predicting the yield of control plants was not affected by the inclusion of salt-stressed plants within the models. This research demonstrates that it is possible to predict the average biomass and yield up to 8 weeks prior to harvest within 4.23% of field-based measurements and up to 4 weeks prior to harvest at the individual plant level. Results from this work may be useful in providing guidance for yield forecasting of healthy and salt-stressed tomato plants, which in turn may inform growing practices, logistical planning, and sales operations.

The halting and correcting strategy is proposed to assign orders to UAVs in consideration of the similarity between the UAV's picking list and the orders. A UAV starts picking orders by using the ant colony optimization algorithm for the orders initially assigned. For additional orders, the UAV modifies the picking sequence and UAV's path in real time by using the k-opt-based algorithm. We evaluated the proposed method by changing the parameters in a simulation of a general warehouse layout. The results show that the proposed method not only reduces completion time compared to the previous algorithm but also reduces UAV's travel distance and the collapsed time.

The UAV typically carries offensive ordnance, target designators, sensors or electronic transmitters designed for one or more applications. Such application can be in the field of defence surveillance, border patrol, search, bomb disposals, logistics and so forth. These UAVs are also being used in some other areas, such as medical purposes including for medicine delivery, rescue operations, agricultural applications and so on. However, these UAVs can only fly in the sky, and they cannot travel on the ground for other applications. Therefore, in this paper, we design and present the novel concept-based UAV, which can also travel on the ground and rough terrain as an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). This means that according to our requirement, we can use this as a quadcopter and caterpillar wheel-based UGV using a single remote control unit. Further, the current study also briefly discusses the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) SolidWorks models of the novel concept-based combined vehicle (UAV + UGV), together with a physical model of a combined vehicle (UAV + UGV) and its various components. Moreover, the kinematic analysis of a combined vehicle (UAV + UGV) has been studied, and the motion controlling kinematic equations have been derived. Then, the real-time aerial and ground motions and orientations and control-based experimental results of a combined vehicle (UAV + UGV) are presented to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed vehicle.

However, autopilot systems fail to navigate due to lost or jammed GNSS signal. To solve this problem, information from other sensors such as optical sensors are used. Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been developed over the last few years and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., visual SLAM algorithms achieve centimeter-level precision in an in-doors environment). Also, map matching localization approaches are used for UAV localization relatively to imagery from static maps such as Google Maps. Unfortunately, the accuracy and robustness of these algorithms are very dependent on up-to-date maps. The purpose of this research is to improve the accuracy and robustness of map-relative particle filter-based localization using a downward-facing optical camera mounted on an autonomous aircraft. This research shows how image similarity to likelihood conversion function impacts the results of particle filter localization algorithm. Two parametric image similarity to likelihood conversion functions (logistic and rectifying) are proposed. A dataset of simulated aerial imagery is used for experiments. The experiment results are shown, that the particle filter localization algorithm using the logistic function was able to surpass the accuracy of state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM2 algorithm by 2.6 times.

Addressing the need for improved logistics operations during such crises, this article presents an innovative approach, namely integrating vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) logistics to enhance the efficiency and resilience of medical supply chains. Our study introduces a dual-mode distribution framework which employs the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for efficiently clustering demand zones unreachable by conventional vehicles, thereby identifying areas requiring UAV delivery. Furthermore, we categorize the demand for medical supplies into two distinct sets based on vehicle accessibility, optimizing distribution routes via both UAVs and vehicles. Through comparative analysis, our findings reveal that the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm significantly outperforms the genetic algorithm in terms of solving efficiency, iteration counts, and delivery speed. However, the ABC algorithm's tendency toward early local optimization and rapid convergence leads to potential stagnation in local optima. To mitigate this issue, we incorporate a simulated annealing technique into the ABC framework, culminating in a refined optimization approach which successfully overcomes the limitations of premature local optima convergence. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our enhanced algorithm, demonstrating reduced iteration counts, shorter computation times, and substantially improved solution quality over traditional logistic models. The proposed method holds promise for significantly improving the operational efficiency and service quality of the healthcare system's logistics during critical situations.

This may be accomplished by handing off the mission tasks to fully fueled replacement UAVs when the current fleet grows weary. The drained UAVs then seek replenishment from nearby logistics support facilities. To support the vision of a persistent fleet of UAVs pursuing missions across a field of operations, we develop an improved mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that can serve to support the system's efforts to orchestrate the operations of numerous UAVs, missions and logistics facilities.

Hybrid delivery systems combining trucks and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as innovative approaches to meet these demands. This study develops a comprehensive mathematical model to optimize such systems, addressing key challenges such as UAV limitations (short range, cargo weight, and energy constraints) and the influence of weather conditions (wind speed, wind direction, and temperature). A significant contribution of this work is the simultaneous consideration of weather factors on both truck energy consumption and UAV flight performance, enabling realistic and adaptive logistics planning. In the proposed system, UAVs operate alongside trucks, returning for recharging after completing their assigned deliveries, which enhances operational feasibility. The model is designed to minimize two objectives: delivery time and cost. Small problem instances are solved using CPLEX solver for validation, while larger instances are tackled using NSGA-II and MOPSO meta-heuristic algorithms. Sensitivity analyses further explore the impact of weather parameters on system performance, offering valuable insights into its adaptability under uncertain conditions.

This paper presents the development methodology of an evolutionary-based optimization framework designed to tackle a specific formulation of a Drone Delivery Problem (DDP) with charging hubs. The proposed evolutionary-based optimization framework is based on a double-chromosome task encoding logic. The goal of the algorithm is to find optimal (and feasible) UAV task assignments such that (i) the tasks' due dates are met, (ii) an energy consumption model is minimized, (iii) re-charge tasks are allocated to ensure service persistency, (iv) risk-aware flyable paths are included in the paradigm. Hard and soft constraints are defined such that the optimizer can also tackle very demanding instances of the DDP, such as tens of package delivery tasks with random temporal deadlines. Simulation results show how the algorithm's development methodology influences the capability of the UAVs to be assigned to different tasks with different temporal constraints. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the results for two different realistic scenarios in the city of Turin, Italy.

Hybrid delivery systems combining trucks and drones have gained attention to overcome this challenge. Traditional models assume trucks park at customer sites while drones handle additional deliveries, yet this approach may hinder drone efficiency due to constraints in parking availability.

By advantageously coupling the individual and aggregated attributes of diverse multi-UAV fleets, a range of high-value applications such as logistics, enhanced disaster response, urban navigation, and surveillance can be significantly improved. However, enabling effective communication for knowledge fusion necessitates the intrinsic optimization of performance metrics like energy consumption, resource allocation, latency, and computational overheads to enhance autonomous efficiency. Furthermore, designing robust security features is essential to safeguarding privacy, control, and operational integrity. This paper explores a novel collaborative knowledge-sharing (KS) framework that leverages 6G and edge-computing capabilities to facilitate the cooperative training of decentralized machine learning models among multiple UAVs, without the need to transmit raw data. This framework aims to enhance the learning experience and operational efficiency of autonomous vehicles. The DECKS (distributed edge-based collaborative knowledge-sharing) architecture enables Federated Learning (FL) within UAV networks, allowing local models to be trained and shared among neighboring UAVs for creating global models. This promotes intelligent knowledge aggregation without a central entity, enhancing collaborative capabilities among autonomous vehicles. The DECKS architecture efficiently extracts and distributes collaborative shared experience to ground vehicles through edge and direct inference, reducing energy consumption, latency, and computational overhead. Our simulation analysis demonstrates that the DECKS architecture has the potential to reduce energy consumption by 70% in sensorless vehicles and improve autonomous vehicle learning performance by 15% compared to centralized approaches in a distributed environment. This improvement is achieved by comparing the efficiency of systems with and without aggregated knowledge, as well as with a centralized system.

To fill this void, a decision support model has been developed to select an optimal drone for two specific scenarios related to medical supplies delivery. Design/methodology/approach The authors proposed a methodology that incorporates graph theory and matrix approach (GTMA) to select an optimal drone for two specific scenarios related to medical supplies delivery at (1) urban areas and (2) rural/remote areas based on a set of criteria and sub-criteria critical for successful drone implementation. Findings The findings of this study indicate that drones equipped with payload handling capacity and package handling flexibility get more preference in urban region scenarios. In contrast, drones with longer flight distances are prioritized most often for disaster case scenarios where the road communication system is either destroyed or inaccessible. Research limitations/implications The methodology formulated in this paper has implications in both academic and industrial settings. This study addresses critical gaps in the existing literature by formulating a mathematical model to find the most suitable drone for a specific scenario based on its criteria and sub-criteria rather than considering a fleet of drones is always at one's disposal. Practical implications This research will serve as a guideline for the practitioners to select the optimal drone in different scenarios related to medical supplies delivery. Social implications The proposed methodology incorporates GTMA to assist decision-makers in order to appropriately choose a particular drone based on its characteristics crucial for that scenario. Originality/value This research will serve as a guideline for the practitioners to select the optimal drone in different scenarios related to medical supplies delivery.

The increasing demand for UAVs in different industries such as agriculture, logistics, and emergency response has led to the development of more sophisticated and advanced UAVs. However, the limited onboard energy resource of UAVs poses a major problem for their long-term operation and endurance. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) could allow UAVs to make more informed and intelligent decisions regarding their operations, resulting in sustainable and more energy-efficient UAV deployment. This article designs a Hybrid Snake Optimizer-based Route Selection Approach for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Communication (HSO-RSAUAVC) technique. The goal of the HSO-RSAUAVC technique is to explore and select optimal routes for UAV communication. In the presented HSO-RSAUAVC technique, the SO algorithm is integrated with Bernoulli Chaotic Mapping and Levy flight (LF) for enhanced performance. In addition, the HSO-RSAUAVC method derives a fitness function including residual energy (RE), distance, and UAV degree. By incorporating the HSO-RSAUAVC technique, we can dynamically adapt UAV paths to overcome obstacles, decrease communication interference, and optimize energy utilization. To validate the performance of the proposed model, a series of simulations were performed. The comparative result analysis illustrates the better performance of the HSO-RSAUAVC technique in improving the performance and reliability of UAV communication.

{"TI": "A reliable unmanned aerial vehicle multi-ship tracking method", "AB": "As the global economy expands, waterway transportation has become increasingly crucial to the logistics sector. This growth presents both significant challenges and opportunities for enhancing the accuracy of ship detection and tracking through the application of artificial intelligence. This article introduces a multi-object tracking system designed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), utilizing the YOLOv7 and Deep SORT algorithms for detection and tracking, respectively. To mitigate the impact of limited ship data on model training, transfer learning techniques are employed to enhance the YOLOv7 model's performance. Additionally, the integration of the SimAM attention mechanism within the YOLOv7 detection model improves feature representation by emphasizing salient features and suppressing irrelevant information, thereby boosting detection capabilities. The inclusion of the partial convolution (PConv) module further enhances the detection of irregularly shaped or partially occluded targets. This module minimizes the influence of invalid regions during feature extraction, resulting in more accurate and stable features. The implementation of PConv not only improves detection accuracy and speed but also reduces the model's parameters and computational demands, making it more suitable for deployment on computationally constrained UAV platforms. Furthermore, to address issues of false negatives during clustering in the Deep SORT algorithm, the IOU metric is replaced with the DIOU metric at the matching stage. This adjustment enhances the matching of unlinked tracks with detected objects, reducing missed detections and improving the accuracy of target tracking. Compared to the original YOLOv7+Deep SORT model, which achieved an MOTA of 58.4% and an MOTP of 78.9%, the enhanced system achieves a MOTA of 65.3% and a MOTP of 81.9%. This represents an increase of 6.9% in MOTA and 3.0% in MOTP. After extensive evaluation and analysis, the system has demonstrated robust performance in ship monitoring scenarios, offering valuable insights and serving as a critical reference for ship surveillance tasks.

The control strategy comprises a position loop and an attitude loop. The position loop, which functions as the outer loop, employs a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) sliding mode surface to eliminate steady-state error through an integral component. Conversely, the attitude loop, serving as the inner loop, utilizes a fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode approach to achieve finite-time convergence and ensure a quick system response. The time-delay estimation technique is employed for the online estimation and real-time compensation of unknown disturbances, while SMC is used to enhance the robustness of the control system. The combination of time-delay estimation and SMC offers complementary advantages. The stability of the system is proven using Lyapunov theory. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation and flight tests demonstrate that the control law can achieve a smooth and continuous output. The proposed control strategy can be effectively applied in complex scenarios, such as hovering, crash recovery, and high maneuverability flying, with significant practicality in engineering applications.

Numerous corporations are investing in initiatives to explore drone logistics capabilities. However, drones' limited delivery range due to their inherent battery ca-pacity constraints remains a challenge. To address this issue, the hybrid delivery system, combining trucks and drones, has emerged as a promising solution and has been the focus of recent studies. Most prior research as-sumes that trucks park at customer locations while drones make auxiliary deliveries, but this approach can limit drone efficiency by restricting flights to customer sites, which may not always be the most suitable parking spots. A recent study proposed a new variation of the truck-drone delivery system, the Drone Routing Problem with Truck (DRP-T), which uses drones as the primary delivery system and features launch locations separate from customer sites (Jeong and Lee, 2021). DRP-T has demonstrated superior delivery capabilities, albeit with increased problem complexity. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of establishing parking locations by comparing scenarios with customer location launching to further examine DRP-T's delivery capabilities. Addi-tionally, we compare DRP-T to the well-known single truck, multi-drone model to further investigate DRP-T's potential. To mitigate DRP-T's complexity, we propose a computationally efficient heuristic algorithm. Nu-merical experiments quantitatively demonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness and reveal substantial savings with DRP-T. Moreover, we present a sensitivity analysis to support economic decision-making in various operational environments.

Findings The investigation into the effects of compression ratio variation via fluid dynamic simulation and experimental testing has allowed an assessment of the approach for improving heavy fuel operation of UAV engines using auxiliary transfer port fuel injection. The power level achieved with reduced compression ratio heavy fuel operation is equal to 15.35 kW at 6,500 revolutions per minute compared to 16.27 kW from the standard gasoline engine or a reduction of 5.7%.

Although control, navigation, and communication technologies are becoming available on individual flight units, system-level motion management for dense UAS traffic remains an open question. This paper presents a motion-planning model based on nonlinear optimization techniques to centrally coordinate paths for all vehicles traversing a shared two-dimensional (2D) space. An exact bound is derived to characterize the discrete-time separation constraints, and a set of new metrics is proposed to measure 2D traffic flow efficiency. The grand goal is to make all vehicles that come under dispatch reach their respective destinations quickly and efficiently while maintaining a safe intervehicle separation at all times. This infinite-horizon operational problem is formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex optimization model that must be solved in a progressive, receding-horizon fashion. To ensure feasibility and overcome path deadlocks attributed to local optima, a series of heuristic measures are developed. By pivoting on artfully coined intermediate feasibility, the algorithm is able to circumvent imminent deadlocks in a predictive manner and progressively construct the solution with guaranteed feasibility.

With efficient algorithms for UAV task planning, the UAVs can autonomously serve the customers in real time. Nearly uninterrupted customer service may be accomplished via the cooperative hand-off of customer tasks from weary UAVs to ones that have recently been replenished at an LSS. With the goal of enabling the autonomy of the task planning tasks, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem of providing simultaneous. UAV escort service to multiple customers across a field of operations with multiple sharable LSSs. This MILP model provides a formal representation of our problem and enables use in a rolling horizon planner via allowance of arbitrary UAV initial locations and consumable reservoir status (e.g., battery level). As such, it enables automation of the orchestration of system activities. To address computational complexity, we develop efficient heuristics to rapidly derive near optimal solutions. A receding horizon task assignment (RHTA) heuristic and sequential task assignment heuristic (STAH) are developed. STAH exploits properties observed in optimal solutions obtained for small problems via CPLEX. Numerical studies suggest that RHTA and STAH are 45 and 2100 times faster than solving the MILP via CPLEX, respectively. Both heuristics perform well relative to the optimal solution obtained via CPLEX. An example demonstrating the use of the approach for rolling horizon planning is provided.

Technological advances such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based logistics systems have thus emerged as promising solutions in urban environments and are increasingly being piloted worldwide. However, the implementation of UAV logistics risks exacerbating social inequities, particularly in marginalized communities that may disproportionately bear the noise and safety risks. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to integrate social equity considerations into urban UAV logistics. This study explores social equity factors through a systematic literature review and social media analysis of Xiaohongshu (the Little Red Book), a popular Chinese social media platform known for its extensive user base and active discussions on social issues. This literature review involves a full-text examination, while latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is used to analyze social media comment datasets. Each method identifies social equity factors and separately assesses their relative importance, resulting in the final identification of 24 key factors that provide a holistic view of public sentiment and academic discourse. The findings reveal a divide between academic concerns around systemic risks and a public focus on immediate needs. By synthesizing these insights, this study provides a social equity landscape for urban UAV logistics and actionable references for policymakers and stakeholders.

Four multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with the decomposed winner determination problem model are experimented. This study is able to yield Pareto optimal solutions from multiple runs of mixed linear integer programming (MILP) using different objectives weights in the model. Unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, has potential to reduce cost and save time for last-mile logistic operations. The result positively shows MOEAs are more efficient than MILP in yielding a set of feasible solutions for undertaking complex winner determination problem models. The percentage of improvement in terms of time spent identifying the best option is almost 100%.

Nowadays, bushfires are taken into account as a major global challenging subject. Indeed, forests are very vulnerable to fires, and the classical patrol systems cannot patrol all areas of the forest and pastures due to the difficult crossing of some routes. The literature survey demonstrated that the mathematical models are an efficient approach for planning forest and rangeland patrols. Drones and trucks are used in cooperation for forest monitoring in this study, with drones acting as an efficient and accurate means of monitoring routes that are impassable to ground vehicles. However, this novel approach deals with several substantial challenges, including limitation in the drone's battery and the routing problem in an integrated truck-drone system based on considering hard-to-reach areas and creating a trade-off between time and cost of the patrol process. These issues make significant differences between the proposed novel approach and the classical vehicle routing problem. Thus, it is essential to develop a comprehensive approach to resolve these crucial issues. The present study develops a multi objective mathematical programming model as mixed-integer programming for simultaneous patrolling of trucks and drones. The augmented epsilon constraint (AEC) method has been considered to solve the two-objective mathematical programming model. Besides, Benders' decomposition (BD) algorithm has been employed to evaluate the achieved results in large-size problems. The performance of the BD algorithm has been confirmed in this study. The findings indicated that the proposed model efficiently protected the forest via monitoring all areas, including impassable areas where ground patrolling is impossible (e.g., the lack of roads due to dense vegetation). Also, it was proved that this system was a novel, cost-effective patrol, which prevents uncontrollable fires in the shortest possible time.

However, it brings a number of challenges including inaccurate positioning of the end effector and limited energy sources. Moreover, solutions so far have difficulty in handling a variety of objects. A novel closed structure compliant gripper was developed to address the challenges above. The gripper has a large self-centering work envelope and is normally-closed for passive grasping. Introduction of compliance as a form of morphological computation was also considered to enhance grasping capabilities, where multi-material 3D printing would facilitate rapid design changes based on target application. To grasp different objects, the gripper has hot-swappable 3D printed fingertips which are optimized with a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization process using physical bench experiments mimicking drone grasping and ascent on a common object set. The morphology of the fingertip including tip width, curvature and distribution of soft and hard material on contact surface, are optimized with a bench test that mimics quadcopter takeoff and landing. The best design from optimization shows an improvement of more than 10% from the initial design in successful grasp operations, demonstrated by field tests with a quadcopter.

In this system, truck and UAV operations are synchronized, i.e., one or more UAVs travel on a truck, which serves as a mobile depot. Deliveries can be made by both UAVs and the truck. While the truck follows a multi-stop route, each UAV delivers a single shipment per dispatch. The presented optimization model minimizes the waiting time of customers in the system. The model determines the optimal allocation of customers to truck and UAVs, the optimal route sequence of the truck, and the optimal launch and reconvene locations of the UAVs along the truck route. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and conduct a bound analysis to gauge the maximum potential of the proposed system to reduce customer waiting time compared to a traditional truck-only delivery system. To be able to solve real-world problem size instances, we propose an efficient Truck and Drone Routing Algorithm (TDRA). The solution quality and computational performance of the mathematical model and the TDRA are compared together and with the truck-only model based on a variety of problem instances. Further, we apply the TDRA to a real-world case study for e-commerce delivery in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Our numerical results suggest significant reductions in customer waiting time to be gained from the proposed multi-modal delivery model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While organisations already employ UAVs for damage assessment during relief delivery, there is a lack of research into formalising a problem that considers both aspects simultaneously. This paper presents a novel endogenous stochastic vehicle routing problem that coordinates UAV and relief vehicle deployments to minimise overall mission cost. The algorithm considers stochastic damage levels in a transport network, with UAVs surveying the network to determine the actual network damages. Ground vehicles are simultaneously routed based on the information gathered by the UAVs. A case study based on the Haiti road network is solved using a greedy solution approach and an adapted genetic algorithm. Both methods provide a significant improvement in vehicle travel time compared to a deterministic approach and a non-assisted relief delivery operation, demonstrating the benefits of UAV-assisted response.

Among myriad factors that can affect human identification and counts of animals from drone images, we focused on three factors typically controlled in the study design or by the drone pilot: flight altitude, camera angle, and time of day. Identifying interactions and patterns among these three variables represents an important first step to determining best survey practices. We used a drone to survey known numbers of eight animal decoy species, representing a range of body sizes and colors, at four ground sampling distance (GSD) values (0.35, 0.70, 1.06, and 1.41 cm/pixel) representing equivalent flight altitudes (15.2, 30.5, 45.7, and 61.0 m) at two camera angles (45 degrees and 90 degrees) and across a range of times of day (morning to late afternoon). Expert human observers identified and counted animals from drone images to determine how the three controllable factors affected accuracy and precision. Observer precision was high and unaffected by tested factors. However, results for observer accuracy revealed an interaction among all three controllable factors. Increasing flight altitude resulted in decreased accuracy in animal counts overall; however, accuracy was best at midday than during the morning and afternoon, when decoy and structure shadows were present or more pronounced. Surprisingly, the 45 degrees camera enhanced accuracy more than the 90 degrees camera, but only when animals were most difficult to identify and count, such as at higher flight altitudes or during the early morning and late afternoon. We provide recommendations for improving human accuracy in identifying and counting animals from drone images used in monitoring animal populations and communities. These results should be incorporated into drone survey design in addition to considering funding, logistical, and animal behavior constraints.

However, integrating UAVs into B5G networks poses various security and privacy concerns. These risks encompass the possibility of unauthorized access, breaches of data, and cyber-physical attacks which jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of UAV operations. Moreover, UAVs in B5G networks are also at high risk from the application of machine learning (ML)-based attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial manipulation, data poisoning and model evasion techniques, which can compromise the integrity of UAV operations, lead to navigation errors, and expose sensitive data collected by UAVs. Considering the aforementioned security and privacy concerns, this review article presents emerging security and privacy solutions for UAVs in B5G networks. Firstly, We introduce the essential background of integrating UAVs into B5G networks and discuss the advantages and security challenges which the emerging integrated network architecture have. Then, we proceed to analyze and examine the security and privacy landscape by including threats and requirements of UAVs in B5G networks. Based on these threats and requirements, solutions from physical layer security (PLS), blockchain (BC), federated learning (FL) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are discussed and explored in details.

Autonomous delivery solutions can help in tackling urban challenges related to last-mile logistics operations. Urbanization creates higher mobility and transportation demand, which contributes to increased congestion levels, traffic, air pollution, and accident rates. Moreover, mega-trends, such as e-commerce, demand that logistics companies react to increased customer expectations in terms of delivery time and service. Concerning service, electrified autonomous delivery solutions have the potential to operate 24/7 and can help to overcome driver shortages. This paper conducts a systematic literature review. Based on the literature set, a snowballing procedure was applied. Complementary gray literature was included. This work discusses different autonomous delivery solutions such as Autonomous Delivery Robots (ADRs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), two- or multi-tiered systems, and the concept of passenger and freight integration. The work presents advantages and disadvantages, enabling the comparison of solutions. Furthermore, a research agenda is provided, from which practical-managerial and theoretical implications can be derived. The research agenda can help researchers, manufacturers, businesses, and governmental institutions to prepare for the arrival and subsequent implementation of autonomous delivery services. Various implications related to energy demand, legislation, implementation strategy, training, and risk and safety are presented.

Design/methodology/approach - Experimental research and development is carried out via dynamometer testing of systems capable of achieving cold start of a spark ignition UAV engine on kerosene JET A-1 fuel. Findings - Repeatable cold starts have been satisfactorily achieved at ambient temperatures of 5 degrees C. The approximate threshold for warm engine restart has also been established. Practical implications - For safety and supply logistical reasons, the elimination of the use of gasoline fuel offers major advantages not only for UAVs but also for other internal combustion engine-powered equipment to be operated in military theatres of operation. For gasoline crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engines, this presents development challenges in terms of modification of the lubrication strategy, achieving acceptable performance characteristics and the ability to successfully secure repeatable engine cold start. Originality/value - The majority of UAVs still operate on gasoline-based fuels. Successful modification to allow low volatility fuel operation would address single fuel policy objectives.

UAVs are widely used through different phases of construction, from aerial mapping, safety and quality monitoring and site logistics to structural inspection and maintenance assessment. While there is significant research about the benefits of UAVs for specific construction-related tasks, there is a dearth of research examining the impact of working with or near UAVs on the health and safety of workers. In this theory-driven paper, we examined UAV integration in construction workplaces from a health and safety perspective, categorized the potential ways UAVs might affect the construction workers' health and safety, and provided a roadmap for future research in this area. The study used inferential and VR visualization techniques to identify the risks posed by UAVs, which were categorized into three groups of (1) physical risks, (2) attentional costs, and (3) psychological impacts. We then proposed a concurrent and cross-functional two-branch research road map to advance our knowledge about human-UAV interactions and develop regulatory and technological measures to ensure safe integration of UAVs in construction. The first branch shall empirically evaluate different ways UAVs can adversely impact workers' health and safety. The second branch shall use these findings to develop regulatory and administrative interventions to guide the UAVs' safe operation on construction sites and develop innovative hardware and software components for future UAVs to ensure their safe co-operation with human workers.

In the context of the COVID-2019, in order to control the development of the epidemic, many places have adopted measures to isolate and close the area once a confirmed case is found. While reducing the contact between people, it also blocks the normal driving of vehicles. Only by changing the traditional logistics and distribution methods can customers who have been in a closed and isolated area for a long time be served. Therefore, we use the Cooperative UGV-UAV to achieve it. In this article, when commanding cooperative UGV and UAV for emergency resource delivery, we mainly focus on two questions: how to accept the operation order (OPORD) from the commander, how to generate a nested vehicle routing planning. We first employ one intelligent task understanding module to drive the intelligent unmanned vehicles to accept and process the C-BML (Coalition Battle Management Language) formatted OPORD with 5W (what, who, where, why, when) elements. Then, we slove the nested vehicle routing planning problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) with the outputs of what is the UGV route, what is the UGV sortie, and how to control the customers' distribution between the UGV and the UAV. Experimental results of random instances and case study show that using the iterative improvement algorithm increase the speed rate of solving more than 10%.

The impetus for this interest is largely due to technological progress and innovation. This paper presents a model based on stochastic Petri nets (SPN) for evaluating the operational efficiency of drone delivery systems, with an emphasis on the completion times for tasks executed by either individual or multiple collaborating drones. Recognizing the limitation of drones' operational duration, chiefly hindered by battery life, the paper suggests the creation of strategic charging stations and the adoption of cooperative delivery tactics as potential solutions, albeit with inherent costs. Two SPN models were developed within this study: one depicting solo drone missions and another depicting cooperative missions with package transfers between drones. These models facilitate the examination of several performance indicators, such as Utilization Level, Mean Mission Time, Delivery Rate, and the probability of delivering a set number of packages within a designated period. By utilizing Design of Experiments (DoE) methods for sensitivity analysis, the study pinpoints essential factors that impact the performance of deliveries and offers strategies for the enhancement of drone delivery networks. The paper concludes by asserting that strategic placement of charging stations coupled with collaborative delivery efforts can effectively mitigate the limitations posed by drones' battery life, thereby augmenting the overall efficacy and feasibility of drone-based delivery services. The SPN models provide a robust predictive framework for drone delivery performance, aiding in improved planning and allocation of resources. The findings underscore the advantages of cooperative drone operations in urban logistics and call for additional research on the optimization of charging station placement and the refinement of collaborative drone strategies.

All advance requests must be satisfied, and the related operating constraints ensured in the model. The model aims to minimize the total operating cost. To effectively solve large problems that may occur in practice, this study develops a relax-and-fix heuristic.

Acting as a crucial link segment of the SAGIN, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-satellite communication has drawn much attention. However, it is a key challenge to track dynamic channel information due to the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite orbiting and three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectory. In this paper, we explore the 3D channel tracking for a Ka-band UAV-satellite communication system. We firstly propose a statistical dynamic channel model called 3D two-dimensional Markov model (3D-2D-MM) for the UAV-satellite communication system by exploiting the probabilistic insight relationship of both hidden value vector and joint hidden support vector. Specifically, for the joint hidden support vector, we consider a more realistic 3D support vector in both azimuth and elevation direction. Moreover, the spatial sparsity structure and the time-varying probabilistic relationship between degree patterns named the spatial and temporal correlation, respectively, are studied for each direction. Furthermore, we derive a novel 3D dynamic turbo approximate message passing (3D-DTAMP) algorithm to recursively track the dynamic channel with the 3D-2D-MM priors. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm achieves superior channel tracking performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms with lower pilot overhead and comparable complexity.

They are particularly useful for tasks that are dull, hazardous, or dirty. Whether the use of drone delivery is beneficial to the environment and cost saving is still a topic under debate. Ideally, drones yield lower energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing environmental sustainability. In this research, we analytically study the impact of UAVs on CO2 emission and cost. We propose a mixed-integer (0-1 linear) green routing model for UAV to exploit the sustainability aspects of the use of UAVs for last-mile parcel deliveries. A genetic algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the complex model, and an extensive experiment is conducted to illustrate and validate the analytical model and the solution algorithm. We find that optimally routing and delivering packages with UAVs would save energy and reduce carbon emissions.

Efficient deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) potentially mitigates this problem, supplementing truck fleets in an impactful manner. To plan last-mile relief distribution in this setting, we introduce a multi-trip, split-delivery vehicle routing problem with trucks and UAVs, soft time windows, and stochastic travel times for last-mile relief distribution, formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. Within a finite time horizon, we aim to maximize a weighted objective function comprising the number of goods delivered, the number of different locations visited, and late arrival penalties. Our study offers insights into dealing with travel time uncertainty in humanitarian logistics by (i) deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as partial substitutes for trucks, (ii) evaluating dynamic solutions generated by two deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches - specifically value function approximation (VFA) and policy function approximation (PFA) - and (iii) comparing the RL solutions with solutions stemming from mathematical programming and dynamic heuristics. Experiments are performed on both Solomon-based instances and two real-world cases. The real-world cases - the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the 2018 Indonesia tsunami - are based on locally collected field data and real-world UAV specifications, and aim to provide practical insights. The experimental results show that dynamic decision-making improves both performance and robustness of humanitarian operations, achieving reductions in lateness penalties of around 85% compared to static solutions based on expected travel times. Furthermore, the results show that replacing half of the trucks with UAVs improves the weighted objective value by 11% to 56%, benefitting both reliability and location coverage. The results indicate that both the deployment of UAVs and the use of dynamic methods successfully mitigate travel time uncertainties in humanitarian operations.

{"TI": "Model of the LOS Probability for the UAV Channel and Its Application for Environment Awareness", "DE": "UAV; LOS; curve fitting; environment awareness", "AB": "Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in many applications, such as in transportation logistics, public safety, or even in non-terrestrial networks (NTN). In all these scenarios, it is an important issue to model channel behavior between the UAV and the user equipment (UE) on the ground. Among these channel features, a critical parameter that dominates channel behavior is the probability of the line-of-sight (LOS), since the statistical property of the channel fading can be either Ricean or Rayleigh, depending on the existence of LOS. Besides, with knowledge of LOS probability, operators can design approaches or schemes to maximum system performance, such as the serving coverage, received signal to noise ratio (SNR), or the bit error rate (BER) with the limited transmitted power. However, the LOS UAV channel is likely difficult to acquire or derive, as it depends on the deployment scenario, such as an urban or rural area. In this paper, we generated four different scenarios defined by the ITU via the ray tracing simulator. Then, we used the spatial geometric relation and the curve fitting approach to derive the analytic models to predict the probability of the UAV LOS channels for different scenarios. Results show that our proposed relationships yield better prediction results than the methods in the literature. Besides, an example of establishing UAV self-awareness ability for the deployed environment via using proposed models is also provided in this paper.

They are forbidden to fly in some airspace. To ensure the safety of UAVs, reasonable path planning and design is one of the key factors. Aiming at the problem of how to improve the success rate of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) maneuver penetration, a method of UAV penetration path planning and design is proposed. Ant colony algorithm has strong path planning ability in biological swarm intelligence algorithm. Based on the modeling of UAV planning and threat factors, improved ant colony algorithm is used for UAV penetration path planning and design. It is proposed that the path with the best pheromone content is used as the planning path. Some principles are given for using ant colony algorithm in UAV penetration path planning. By introducing heuristic information into the improved ant colony algorithm, the convergence is completed faster under the same number of iteratives. Compared with classical methods, the total steps reduced by 56% with 50 ant numbers and 200 iterations. 62% fewer steps to complete the first iteration. It is found that the optimal trajectory planned by the improved ant colony algorithm is smoother and the shortest path satisfying the constraints.

It is an enhanced version of the multiple Flying Sidekicks Traveling Salesman Problem (mFSTSP) presented in Murray and Raj (2020) wherein drones are allowed to visit several customers per trip. In order to cope with large instances of the complex TmDTL, we have developed a novel agent-based method where agents represent the points that are going to be visited by vehicles. Agents evolve by means of movement inside a grid (locations vs. vehicles) according to a set of rules in the seek of better objective function values. Each agent needs to explore only a fraction of the complete problem, sharing its progress with the rest of the agents which are coordinated by one central agent which helps to maintain an asynchronous memory of solutions - e.g. on the control of the mechanism to escape from local minima. Our agent-based approach is firstly tested using the largest instances of the single TDTL problem reported in the literature, which additionally serves as upper bounds to the TmDTL problem. Secondly, we have solved instances up to 500 locations with up to 6 drones in the fleet. Thirdly, we have tested the behavior of our approach in 500 locations problems with up to 8 drones in order to test the fleet size sensitivity. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed agent-based system to obtain good quality solutions for complex optimization problems that arise. Further, the abstraction in solutions coding applied makes the agent-based approach scalable and flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of other optimization problems.

While the open network environment facilitates efficient image transmission, it also raises security concerns. To address this, we propose a remote sensing image encryption algorithm based on a novel Exponent-Sine-Logistic (ESL) map and DNA convolution. The algorithm employs a scrambling-diffusion framework within the DNA domain. In the scrambling phase, the DNA codes of multiple images are scrambled using a chaotic sequence generated by the ESL map. In the diffusion phase, the scrambled DNA codes are further modified using DNA convolution, integrating multiple DNA operations to enhance security. Additionally, the algorithm improves efficiency through fast dynamic DNA encoding and decoding methods. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieves an information entropy of 7.9998 and encrypts four 256 x 256 images in just 0.7455 s. The algorithm demonstrates superior security and efficiency, effectively resisting common attacks, making it highly applicable in military and surveying fields.

Detailed models of the UAV, buoy, and the coupled tethered system dynamics are presented in a marine environment that includes surface water currents and oscillating gravity waves, in addition to wind gusts. This work extends the previously modeled planar (vertical) motion of this novel robotic system to allow its free motion in all three dimensions. Furthermore, a directional surge velocity control system (DSVCS) is proposed to allow both the free movement of the UAV around the buoy when the cable is slack, and the manipulation of the buoy's surge velocity when the cable is taut. Using a spherical coordinates system centered at the buoy, the control system commands the UAV to apply forces on the buoy at specific azimuth and elevation angles via the tether, which yields a more appropriate realization of the control problem as compared to the Cartesian coordinates, where the traditional x-, y-, and z-coordinates do not intuitively describe the tether's tension and orientation. The proposed robotic system and controller offer a new method of interaction and collaboration between UAVs and marine systems from a locomotion perspective, and offers a low-cost and low-logistics alternative to crewed vessels for marine missions. It has potential applications in search-and-rescue missions, monitoring and sensing operations, and floating objects manipulation and retrieval.

However, the autonomous navigation for UAVs in indoor map-less environments while performing an inventory mission is, to this day, an open issue for researchers. This article examines the method of leveraging RFID technology with UAVs for the problem of the design of a fully autonomous UAV used for inventory in indoor spaces. This work also proposes a solution for increasing the performance of the autonomous exploration of inventory zones using a UAV in unexplored warehouse spaces. The main idea is to design an indoor UAV equipped with an onboard autonomous navigation system called RFID-based stigmergic and obstacle avoidance navigation system (RFID-SOAN). RFID-SOAN is composed of a computationally low cost obstacle avoidance (OA) algorithm and a stigmergy-based path planning and navigation algorithm. It uses the same RFID tags that retailers add to their products in a warehouse for navigation purposes by using them as digital pheromones or environmental clues. Using RFID-SOAN, the UAV computes its new path and direction of movement based on an RFID density-oriented attraction function, which estimates the optimal path through sensing the density of previously unread RFID tags in various directions relative to the pose of the UAV. We present the results of the tests of the proposed RFID-SOAN system in various scenarios. In these scenarios, we replicate different typical warehouse layouts with different tag densities, and we illustrate the performance of the RFID-SOAN by comparing it with a dead reckoning navigation technique while taking inventory. We prove by the experiments results that the proposed UAV manages to adequately estimate the amount of time it needs to read up-to 99.33% of the RFID tags on its path while exploring and navigating toward new zones of high populations of tags. We also illustrate how the UAV manages to cover only the areas where RFID tags exist, not the whole map, making it very efficient, compared to the traditional map/way-points-based navigation.

Multi-access edge computing (MEC) can reduce the service response time by selecting the required edge computing resources closer to the end device. However, MEC-based smart systems require heterogeneous and diverse services support. Taking unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) last-mile delivery system as an example, there are two types of services required: delivery and computational services. The edge services in MEC environments are distributed and limited. Inefficient service selection plans will affect the quality of services of such smart systems. Therefore, how to design a suitable service selection strategy is a crucial issue for MEC-based smart systems. To address this issue, we propose a service selection framework and a holistic and hybrid service selection ( (HS2)-S-2 ) strategy for MEC-based UAV last-mile delivery systems in real-world UAV last-mile delivery scenarios. This framework considers three important characteristics of UAV delivery systems: diverse service requirements, service availability, and service mobility. The H(2)S(2 )strategy focuses on selecting the optimal delivery and computational services and provides an integrated approach with a static service selection algorithm and a dynamic service re-selection algorithm. The H(2)S(2 )strategy determines the optimal delivery and computational service selection plans with the lowest UAV energy consumption and shortest service response time. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the H(2)S(2 )strategy through ablation studies and comparative analyses with diverse representative strategies. The experimental results show that the H(2)S(2 )strategy improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the UAV delivery system by significantly reducing UAV's energy consumption and service response time.

However, the UAV's limited energy storage makes it difficult to perform long-distance delivery tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal logistics framework based on crowdsourcing, in which the UAVs can call on ground vehicles to provide hitch services for energy saving and extending their delivery distance. This multimodal logistics framework is formulated as a two-stage model to jointly consider the incentive mechanism design for crowdsourced ground vehicles and path planning for UAVs. In Stage I, to deal with the motivations for ground vehicles to assist UAV delivery, a dynamic pricing scheme is proposed to best balance the vehicle response time and payments to ground vehicles. It shows that a higher price should be decided if the vehicle response time is long to encourage more vehicles to offer a ride. In Stage II, the task allocation and path planning of the UAVs over the traffic network is studied on the basis of the vehicle response time obtained in Stage I. To address pathfinding with restrictions and the performance degradation of the pathfinding algorithm due to the rising number of conflicts in multi-agent pathfinding, we propose the suboptimal conflict avoidance-based path search (CABPS) algorithm, which has polynomial time complexity. Finally, we validate our results via simulations. It is shown that our approach is able to increase the success rate of UAV package delivery. Moreover, we estimate the delivery time of the UAV in a pessimistic case, it is still twice as fast as the delivery time of the ground vehicle only. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the growth has also contributed to a rise in maritime accidents, highlighting the need for developing maritime emergency management strategies. In maritime emergency management, resource location-allocation-configuration is the most important and inseparable preparedness action before disasters, directly deciding the quality of emergency rescue operations. Traditional ship-only rescue is frequently both cost-intensive and time-consuming, seriously affecting rescue performance. This study introduces an innovative shipborne UAV operation system to address these limitations. Firstly, a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is established to minimize total rescue time and cost by considering the uncertain maritime environment, continuous docking placements of ships, UAV flight distance, rescue station capacity, etc. Secondly, to efficiently obtain an execution plan, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to facilitate our mission optimization model. Large-scale simulated instances and a real case study demonstrate that (i) the proposed algorithm can solve the model efficiently. (ii) the application of shipborne UAV operation system in maritime emergencies shows a significant improvement in time and cost compared to shiponly system. (iii) it is necessary to consider the uncertain maritime environment when solving emergency management problems. Moreover, extensive parameter sensitivity analysis provides managerial insights into the impact of various factors on the optimization outcomes.

Since UAVs' energy storage capacity is generally low, it is essential to reduce energy costs to improve their system's energy efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a novel trajectory planning framework to achieve the optimal trajectory with the minimum amount of energy consumption under the constraints of obstacles in a static environment. Based on UAV dynamics, we first derived the required power functions of multi-rotor UAVs in vertical and horizontal flight. To generate a feasible trajectory, we first adopted the A* algorithm to find a path and developed a safe flight corridor for the UAV to fly across by expanding the waypoints against the environment, and then proposed a time-discretization method to formulate the trajectory generation problem and solve it by the convex optimization algorithm. The optimization results in a static environment with obstacles demonstrated that the proposed method could efficiently and effectively obtain the optimal trajectory with the minimum amount of energy consumption under different allowed mission times and payloads.

Despite the rapid advance in the field of autonomous drones, the development of ground infrastructure has received less attention. Contemporary airport design offers potential solutions for the infrastructure serving autonomous drone services. To that end, this paper aims to construct a framework for connecting air and ground operations for autonomous drone services. Furthermore, the paper defines the minimum facilities needed to support unmanned aerial vehicles for autonomous logistics and the collection of aerial data. Design/methodology/approachThe paper reviews the state-of-the-art in airport design literature as the basis for analysing the guidelines of manned aviation applicable to the development of ground infrastructure for autonomous drone services. Socio-technical system analysis was used for identifying the service needs of drones. FindingsThe key findings are functional modularity based on the principles of airport design applies to micro-airports and modular service functions can be connected efficiently with an autonomous ground handling system in a sustainable manner addressing the concerns on maintenance, reliability and lifecycle. Research limitations/implicationsAs the study was limited to the airport design literature findings, the evolution of solutions may provide features supporting deviating approaches. The role of autonomy and cloud-based service processes are quintessentially different from the conventional airport design and are likely to impact real-life solutions as the area of future research. Practical implicationsThe findings of this study provided a framework for establishing the connection between the airside and the landside for the operations of autonomous aerial services. The lack of such framework and ground infrastructure has hindered the large-scale adoption and easy-to-use solutions for sustainable logistics and aerial data collection for decision-making in the built environment. Social implicationsThe evolution of future autonomous aerial services should be accessible to all users, \"democratising\" the use of drones. The data collected by drones should comply with the privacy-preserving use of the data. The proposed ground infrastructure can contribute to offloading, storing and handling aerial data to support drone services' acceptability.

However, ensuring safety in the decision-making processes surrounding UAV operations in real-world settings has become an urgent and complex challenge. At present, the main methods to minimise the risk of drone decision-making include utilising pre-established control rules, expert prior knowledge and regularisation constraints. However, these methodologies require UAVs to meet demanding prerequisites, including the acquisition of extensive decision-making experience and the establishment of comprehensive rules. Regrettably, these strict requirements often lead to frequent UAV crashes in uncertain environments and subsequent mission failures. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a self-decision-making method for quadcopter UAVs based on safe reinforcement learning. Our method utilises a multilevel cascading feature semantic space for reinforcement learning, integrating depth images, greyscale images, semantic segmentation images and object detection results as inputs. This approach aims to facilitate safe autonomous learning. Moreover, we integrate real offline labelled data to enhance the safety policy. Depending on the varying levels of risk encountered during the UAV's decision-making process, we dynamically select different safety policies. Through this iterative process, the UAV progressively eliminates extreme actions and reverts to the UAV learning policy module. Experimental results indicate that our method not only ensures safe decision-making for UAVs in uncertain environments but also exhibits superior safety decision-making efficacy compared to certain baseline methods.

Design/methodology/approach This UAV adopts tiltable ducted rotor combined with fixed wing, which has the characteristics of fast flight speed, large carrying capacity and long endurance. At the same time, it has the hovering and vertical take-off and landing capabilities of the rotary-wing UAV. In addition, aerodynamic simulation analysis of the composite model with a fixed wing and a ducted rotor was carried out, and the aerodynamic influence of the composite model on the UAV was analyzed under different speeds, fixed wing angles of attack and ducted rotor speeds. Findings The results were as follows: when the speed of the ducted rotor is 2,500 rpm, CL and K both reach maximum values. But when the speed exceeds 3,000 rpm, the lift will decrease; when the angle of attack of the fixed wing is 10 degrees and the rotational speed of the ducted rotor is about 3,000 rpm, the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing are better. Originality/value The novelty of this work comes from a composite wing design of a fixed wing combined with a tiltable ducted rotor applied to the logistics UAVs, and the aerodynamic characteristics of the design wing are analyzed.

The survey of an active landslide by UAV-based RGB photogrammetry and infrared thermography, sided by the knowledge of the field condition, allowed increasing the scientific experience on the remote sensing of slope instability phenomena by analyzing multiple aspects related to the evolution of key slope features. In this research, the state and distribution of activity of a landslide was monitored by matching data arising from three-dimensional models of the slope, built by exploiting the aerial RGB photogrammetric technology, and thermal outcomes, resulting from the airborne application of infrared thermography principles. In this frame, thermal anomalies detected during different monitoring campaigns allowed recognizing peculiar features along the unstable slope that could be related to specific kinematic elements involved in the landslide activity. Forming cracks, developing scarps, wet terrain portions, and loose material are some of the elements that could be located by integrating thermal outcomes with Digital Surface Models of the slope. Thanks to the different thermal behavior of such elements, strengthened herein by a novel approach of thermal data processing (i.e. the study of thermal slope profiles), the lateral and retrogressive evolution of the studied movement was first hypothesized and then verified in field. Achieved results show that the location of thermal anomalies well corresponds to field structures, which sometimes are hardly detectable by in situ or RGB surveys, thus suggesting the high potential of the methodological approach developed for this study. The scientific validity of presented data gains relevance thanks to the positive field validation. This paves the way to further studies aimed at implementing the infrared aerial survey of landslides, which surely could bring benefits to practical applications in terms of survey speed and spatial coverage, especially in areas characterized by bad field logistics.

{"TI": "Hybrid DNN-Based Flight Power Estimation Framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", "DE": "unmanned aerial vehicles; deep neural network; power consumption; empirical method", "AB": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in logistics and communication, though they were initially used for military purposes. However, because the motor must always be rotated, the flight range of an UAV is limited, which, in turn, restricts the scope of UAV applications. Of course, if UAV power consumption is predicted using AI, it is possible to effectively plan UAV operations by deriving optimal energy-efficient flight paths during the simulation phase. However, when using deep neural networks (DNNs) to build a UAV power consumption model, it is difficult to make accurate inferences based solely on flight velocity data. For precise predictions, random vibration acceleration data, as a result of thrust and resistance, are also required. Unfortunately, such information cannot be obtained during the simulation phase and can only be acquired through the actual flight environment. In this paper, we propose the first hybrid DNN-based power model that combines a DNN-based power consumption model and a data-driven random vibration acceleration model that derives UAV random vibration acceleration information based on flight velocity and environment. The proposed modeling framework was evaluated with flight experiments, demonstrating a 6.12% root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE), which is 39.45% more accurate when compared with a conventional DNN-only power model. In addition, we performed case studies to show that it is possible to find energy-efficient flight paths.

{"TI": "High-accuracy UAV photogrammetry of ice sheet dynamics with no ground control", "AB": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and structure from motion with multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry are increasingly common tools for geoscience applications, but final product accuracy can be significantly diminished in the absence of a dense and well-distributed network of ground control points (GCPs). This is problematic in inaccessible or hazardous field environments, including highly crevassed glaciers, where implementing suitable GCP networks would be logistically difficult if not impossible. To overcome this challenge, we present an alternative geolocation approach known as GNSS-supported aerial triangulation (GNSS-AT). Here, an on-board carrier-phase GNSS receiver is used to determine the location of photo acquisitions using kinematic differential carrier-phase positioning. The camera positions can be used as the geospatial input to the photogrammetry process. We describe the implementation of this method in a low-cost, custom-built UAV and apply the method in a glaciological setting at Store Glacier in western Greenland. We validate the technique at the calving front, achieving topographic uncertainties of +/- 0.12 m horizontally (similar to 1.1 x the ground sampling distance) and +/- 0.14 m vertically (similar to 1.3 x the ground sampling distance), when flying at an altitude of similar to 450 m above ground level. This compares favourably with previous GCP-derived uncertainties in glacial environments and allows us to apply the SfM-MVS photogrammetry at an inland study site where ice flows at 2 m day(-1) and stable ground control is not available. Here, we were able to produce, without the use of GCPs, the first UAV-derived velocity fields of an ice sheet interior. Given the growing use of UAVs and SfM-MVS in glaciology and the geosciences, GNSS-AT will be of interest to those wishing to use UAV photogrammetry to obtain high-precision measurements of topographic change in contexts where GCP collection is logistically constrained.

In this study, the first of its kind commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) urban delivery program in China is targeted. Different from the traditional ground pickup and delivery services, the aerial mode considers not only the time window constraints, but also the spatial conflicts incurred during the take-off and landing operations of UAVs. To obtain the optimal flying routes of the focused problem, a mixed integer programming model is formulated. Due to its inherent complexity, the optimal schedule cannot be attained within acceptable time via the off-the-shelf solvers. To help speed up the solving process, a branch-and-cut based exact algorithm is proposed, together with a series of customized valid inequalities. To further accelerate, a greedy insertion heuristic is designed to secure high-quality initial solutions. In the numerical section, it is observed that the algorithm proposed in this paper can help solve the real-life on-demand UAV delivery problem to near optimum (within 5% optimality gap) within reasonable computation time (in 5 minutes). Note to Practitioners-With the increase of labor cost, the distribution cost increases very rapidly. In the meantime, the employment of automated vehicles for logistics reshapes the landscape of the urban last-mile delivery. As an efficient courier carrier, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is trending the autonomous delivery endeavour. When integrating UAVs into the urban delivery program, practitioners need to pay special attention to the scheduling of UAVs at the operational level in addition to the hardware of the UAVs. To help solve the UAV dispatch problem, we propose an online scheduling scheme, considering the spatial conflict constraints in the actual UAV operations. And an exact algorithm is designed to accelerate the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve near optimal dispatch plan with 5% optimality gap in 5 minutes. Furthermore, it is discovered that the demand pooling is an essential decision to make for UAV-based delivery. Longer pooling time can increase the UAV efficiency with more realized demand information, but too much pooling could lead to prolonged customer waiting and a low service level.

However, based on the current development status of logistics UAVs, there are difficulties in using UAVs directly for door-to-door logistics transportation. Therefore, it is necessary to establish UAV parcel-receiving stations that can gather logistics needs in a small area. The construction of stations allows the UAVs to transport back and forth between the distribution warehouse and the established stations, enabling customers to send and receive packages at the more convenient stations. Based on the current situation, it is a more appropriate air-ground cooperative transport mode to solve the \"last-mile\" cargo transportation problem. In this paper, a bi-layer UAV parcel-receiving station and public air-route planning method is proposed to explore the interaction between station location and public route planning, and is solved with a genetic algorithm and max-min ant system (GA-MMAS). The model proposed in this paper can determine the location of the stations and plan the public air routes between the warehouse and stations simultaneously. Simulation results show that the planning results of the bi-layer optimization model proposed in this paper meet the requirements of station location and public air-route planning. Compared with the layered planning results, the cost of the upper-layer model is reduced by 5.12% on average, and the cost of the lower-layer model is reduced by 4.48%.

To achieve autonomous separation maintenance, it is necessary to conduct autonomous track prediction and formulate the required separation accordingly.

This study consists of two parts. Firstly, based on historical data, the position prediction error of the flight track is investigated. Using a machine learning model, a two-stage track prediction method, which involves classification followed by prediction, is proposed for urban logistics UAV track data. Subsequently, based on the track prediction error distribution, by designing a gas model and a position error probability model, a separation-formulating model for urban logistics UAVs in free flight is proposed in which UAV maneuverability is considered. By applying this model, the required separation is formulated for UAVs. When the required separation is set to 48.5 m, the overall collision risk meets the TLS requirements.

As this technology becomes integrated into forest management approaches, it is important to consider the implementation of proper safety and data collection strategies. The creation of such documentation is beneficial, because it allows for those aspiring to create a UAS program to learn from others' experiences, without bearing the consequences of past blunders associated with the development of these practices. When establishing a UAS program, it is pertinent to deeply research the necessary equipment, create documentation that establishes operational norms, and develop standards for in-field operations. Regarding multispectral vs. RGB sensor payloads, the sensor selection should be based upon what type of information is desired from the imagery acquired. It is also important to consider the methods for obtaining the most precise geolocation linked to the aerial imagery collected by the sensor. While selecting the proper UAS platform and sensor are key to establishing a UAS operation, other logistical strategies, such as flight crew training and operational planning, are equally important. Following the acquisition of proper equipment, further preparations must be made in order to ensure safe and efficient operations. The creation of crew resource management and safety management system documentation is an integral part of any successful UAS program. Standard operating procedure documents for individual tasks and undertakings are also a necessity. Standardized practices for the scheduling, communication, and management of the UAS fleet must also be formulated. Once field operations are set in motion, the continuous improvement of the documentation and best practices is paramount.

Because polar species may be particularly sensitive to disturbance and some research suggests behavioral responses to drones are species-specific, there is a need for focal species-specific disturbance assessments. We evaluated behavioral responses of nesting Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima (Linnaeus, 1758), n =19 incubating females) to first, second, or in a few cases third exposure of fixed-wing drone surveys using nest cameras. We found no effect of drone flights (F-[1,F-23] = 0, P = 1.0) or previous exposures (F-[1,F-23] = 0.75, P = 0.397) on the probability of a daily recess event (bird leaves nests). Drone flights did not impact recess length (F-[1,F-25] =1.34, P = 0.26); however, Common Eiders with prior drone exposure took longer recess events (F-[1,F-25] = 5.27, P = 0.03). We did not observe any overhead vigilance behaviors common in other species while the drone was in the air, which may reflect Common Eiders' anti-predator strategies of reducing activity at nests in response to aerial predators. Surveying nesting Common Eider colonies with a fixed-wing drone did not result in biologically meaningful behavioral changes, providing a potential tool for research and monitoring this polar nesting species.

Despite interesting use-cases receiving worldwide media attention, drones are expected to have their most significant impact on supply chain and logistics systems in highly populated urban cities once the regulations for commercial purposes are lifted. This article proposes two models of drone-delivery technology that can serve as a potential replacement in the Indian truck-delivery system. First, a drone-truck hybrid delivery model is proposed with trucks carrying multiple drones. Second, a stand-alone drone-delivery model is proposed with separate charging infrastructural facilities at specific points. The two proposed models' findings present the advantages of significantly reducing carbon emissions, delivery costs, and time compared to truck-based delivery. The hybrid drone-truck model eliminates the need for separate charging facilities saving initial infrastructural costs. In contrast, the stand-alone drone model utilizes the current warehouse location facilities with charging stations on specific points for ease of adoption. This research presents initial viability suggesting that the drone technology can solve the current operational challenges in India's urban cities.

However, safety regulations for small UAVs in urban areas have not yet been well established, and there are very few studies investigating the collisions between UAVs and building structures that could occur in an urban area. In this study, experimental and numerical investigations are conducted to evaluate the damage resulting from a UAV collision with heat-strengthened glass, a widely used building exterior cladding. Commercially available UAVs were impacted into a series of glass panels at various speeds and angles. The collision processes were recorded with a high-speed camera, and the impact forces of the UAVs were measured using dynamic force sensors. A numerical model of the UAV was then developed to simulate the impacts using the finite element method and verified by comparison with the experimental results. The collision tests performed in this study are expected to provide primary data for establishing UAV safety regulations, and the verified numerical model can be applied to evaluate various collision scenarios for the different UAVs.

A variety of potential UAV applications are emerging nowadays, and UAV delivery is one in the limelight. However, one of the critical issues for UAV delivery service is how UAVs can be persistently used within their fundamental limited battery capacity. One recent approach to alleviate the weaknesses is using a cooperative system of UAVs with movable stations for the delivery logistics. The movable stations move across the field of operation, providing persistent delivery service using UAVs by efficiently replenishing the consumables of UAVs. In this study, one of the compelling cooperative delivery services called the flying warehouse system is investigated. The concept of the flying warehouse delivery service has firstly filed as a patent by the e-commerce giant Amazon. The service utilizes airborne fulfillment centers (AFCs), an airship that floats at an altitude of around 45,000. The airship has stocked with inventory, and when a customer places an order, UAVs fly down and deliver the package. The AFC is a novel delivery system that allows delivery in under 10 min and expands Amazon Prime members' access to UAV shipping. On the other hand, AFC is a challenging system that must extract the simultaneous operating schedule of the different system elements. For this purpose, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed. The proposed MILP enables the derivation of service schedules of multiple AFCs and their components. The validity of the MILP is tested through case studies and quantitatively investigated system managerial issues. In addition, we proposed a clustering-based solution approach to provide computational efficiency for real-world case problems.

Easy access to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has opened up new opportunities for remote gas sampling and provides logistical and economic opportunities to improve GHG measurements. Methods This study presents synchronized gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) methods for the analysis of atmospheric gas samples (20-mL glass vessels) to determine the stable isotope ratios and concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O. To our knowledge there is no comprehensive GC/IRMS setup for successive measurement of CO2, CH4 and N2O analysis meshed with a UAV-based sampling system. The systems were built using off-the-shelf instruments augmented with minor modifications. Results The precision of working gas standards achieved for delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of CO2 was 0.2 parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively. The mid-term precision for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of CH4 and N2O working gas standards was 0.4 parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively. Injection quantities of working gas standards indicated a relative standard deviation of 1%, 5% and 5% for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively. Measurements of atmospheric air samples demonstrated a standard deviation of 0.3 parts per thousand and 0.4 parts per thousand for the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values, respectively, of CO2, 0.5 parts per thousand for the delta C-13 value of CH4 and 0.3 parts per thousand for the delta N-15 value of N2O. Conclusions Results from internal calibration and field sample analysis, as well as comparisons with similar measurement techniques, suggest that the method is applicable for the stable isotope analysis of these three important GHGs. In contrast to previously reported findings, the presented method enables successive analysis of all three GHGs from a single ambient atmospheric gas sample.

Considering the operational constraints of logistics drone, a multi-objective optimisation model is established to balance the social value, energy efficiency and productivity of using logistics drones in the last-mile superchilling delivery. To effectively achieve the above optimisation, improved strategies, including the material exchange mechanism based on the random proportion rule and the Universe-Particle search strategy, are developed, resulting in an improved two-stage heuristic algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in a simulated environment with 154 buildings, and compared with other frontier algorithms used for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning.

Among the emerging solutions, a collaborative delivery model involving drones and trucks addresses last-mile delivery challenges by leveraging the complementary strengths of both modes of transport. However, evaluating the environmental and economic impacts of this transportation mode requires a systematic framework to capture its unique characteristics and minimize environmental impacts and costs. This paper investigates the Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem (PDSTSP) to evaluate the environmental and economic sustainability of a collaborative drone-truck delivery system. Specifically, a mathematical model for this delivery system is developed to optimize joint delivery operations. Environmental impacts are assessed using a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), including emissions and operational noise, while a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) quantifies economic performance across five cost dimensions. Sensitivity analysis explores factors such as delivery density, traffic congestion, and wind conditions. Results show that, compared to the electric vehicle fleet, the proposed model achieves an approximate 20% reduction in carbon emissions, while delivering a 20-30% cost reduction relative to the fuel truck fleet. Drones' efficiency in short-distance deliveries alleviates trucks' load, cutting environmental and operational costs.

One of the key challenges is the difficulty in synchronizing the images acquired by UAV spectral sensors and ground-truth in situ water quality measurements for calibration, due to a typical time delay between these two modes of data acquisition. This study investigates the logistics for the concurrent deployment of the UAV-borne spectral sensors and a sampling vessel for water quality measurements and the effects on the turbidity predictions due to the time delay between these two operations. The results show that minimizing the time delay can significantly enhance the efficiency of data acquisition and consequently improve the calibration process. In particular, the outcomes highlight notable improvements in the model's predictive accuracy for turbidity distribution derived from UAV-borne spectral images. Furthermore, a comparative analysis based on a pilot study is conducted between two multirotor UAV configurations: the DJI M600 Pro with a hyperspectral camera and the DJI M300 RTK with a multispectral camera. The performance evaluation includes the deployment complexity, image processing productivity, and sensitivity to environmental noises. The DJI M300 RTK, equipped with a multispectral camera, is found to offer higher cost-effectiveness, faster setup times, and better endurance while yielding good image quality at the same time. It is therefore a more compelling choice for widespread industry adoption.

This paper introduces an Improved Rapid random tree (IRRT*) algorithm with triangular inequality rewiring technique for finding collision free path for UAVs in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. The 3D building environments for navigation were developed using MATLAB/Simulink 2021, a virtual occupancy grid model. By considering UAV variable elements such as roll angle, air speed, flight path angle, and boundary threshold parameters, the suggested work aims to provide a comparative analysis of sampling algorithm-based optimal path. The proposed route planning control strategy is to identify the violation free path to locate the destination in 3D environment at variable altitude and air speed. Compared to the standard RRT and RRT* algorithms, the proposed IRRT* algorithm can shorten the planning time, reduce the cost distance and improve the algorithm's applicability in the formation path planning problem. Simulation experiments with two environments and their different situations are carried out to determine the efficiency and performance of the proposed IRRT* algorithm.

Autonomous maritime systems face such challenges insecurely processing and managing large amounts of real-time data while maintaining resilience against cyber attacks. This paper considers these challenges by presenting a federated privacy-preserving UAV data collection framework to optimize autonomous path planning and protect sensitive maritime information. Using UAVs as edge nodes for decentralized data processing allows the framework to integrate federated learning, maintain data privacy, and improve cybersecurity. The proposed framework contains five distinct layers, where the data collection layer's role is to collect real-time data on vessel and environmental conditions. The privacy-preserving edge intelligence layer enables secure localized data processing at the edge. The threat mitigation and optimization layer performs machine learning models for route optimization and intrusion detection. The orchestration layer is implemented to coordinate UAV operations and manages aggregated model parameters for system-wide efficiency, whereas the user interaction layer provides operators with secure, real-time insights into system performance and operational metrics. Simulations and implementations demonstrate that this multilayered architecture improves route accuracy, fortifies data security, and achieves a 20% reduction in emissions, underscoring its potential to advance autonomous navigation and secure, efficient mission planning in maritime cyber-physical systems. The proposed edge-intelligent federated UAV system demonstrates superior performance compared to other approaches, achieving the highest accuracy (99.1%), F1 score (98.9%), and recall (99.3%), while utilizing a larger hybrid dataset (80,000 samples) with 30 features, optimized through principal component analysis, and addressing multiple target attributes such as CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and route accuracy.

In this respect, the delivery mechanism became prohibitively expensive, particularly for the final kilometer. To stay competitive and meet the increased demand, businesses began to look for innovative autonomous delivery options for the last mile, such as autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles/drones, which are a promising alternative for the logistics industry. Following the success of drones in surveillance and remote sensing, drone delivery systems have begun to emerge as a new solution to reduce delivery costs and delivery time. In the coming years, autonomous drone sharing systems will be an unavoidable logistical solution, especially with the new laws/recommendations introduced by the Flight World Organization on how to organize the operations of these special unmanned airline systems. This paper provides a comprehensive literature survey on a set of relevant research issues and highlights the representative solutions and concepts that have been proposed thus far in the design and modeling of the logistics of drone delivery systems, with the purpose of discussing the respective performance levels reached by the various suggested approaches.

However, handover policies in current cellular networks are primarily designed for ground users, and thus are not appropriate for UAVs due to frequent fluctuations of signal strength in the air. This paper presents a novel handover decision scheme deploying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to prevent unnecessary handovers while maintaining stable connectivity. The proposed DRL framework takes the UAV state as an input for a proximal policy optimization algorithm and develops a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based on a reward function for the online learning of UAV handover decisions. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a 3D-emulated UAV mobility environment where it reduces up to 76 and 73% of unnecessary handovers compared to greedy and Q-learning-based UAV handover decision schemes, respectively. Furthermore, this scheme ensures reliable communication with the UAV by maintaining the RSSI above -75 dBm more than 80% of the time.

Typically, one van carries several UAVs. The first echelon involves time-window-driven parcel deliveries using vans from a distribution center (DC) to customers. The second echelon involves UAVs being dispatched from mobile-satellite vans to serve customers with time windows and directly delivering parcels from the DC. When the first-echelon vehicles park at customer locations and wait for second-echelon vehicle departures and returns, the first-echelon vehicles are used as mobile satellites. We develop a vehicle-flow formulation, in which the mobile-satellite synchronization constraints are included to ensure the echelon interaction. We provide an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Computational experiments evaluate the validity of the 2E-VRP-TM formulation and the effectiveness of the heuristic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of UAVs to provide commercial courier has become an emerging industry, remarkably shifting the energy use of the freight sector. However, due to limited battery capacities, the flight duration of civilian rotorcraft UAVs is still short, hindering them from performing remote jobs. In this case, people customarily utilize ground vehicles to carry and assist UAVs in various applications, including cargo delivery. Most previous studies on vehicle-drone cooperative parcel delivery considered only one UAV, thereby suffering from low efficiency when serving a large number of customers. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm, which supports the cooperation of a ground vehicle and multiple UAVs for efficient parcel delivery. Our routing and scheduling algorithm allows multiple UAVs carried by the vehicle to simultaneously deliver multiple parcels to customers residing in different locations. The proposed algorithm consists of a pipeline of several modules: population management, heuristic population initialization, and population education. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm has significant efficiency over existing algorithms.

In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are ideal solutions for last-mile delivery scenarios in recent years due to their fast speed and easy deployment. However, because of the highly automatic delivery process, UAVs are still constrained by the limited payload, battery, and computing capacity for complex computational tasks. With the aid of the mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, UAVs can offload computational tasks to the MEC computational resources in various types of IoT environments. In spite of the task offloading which can enhance their task process capability, it also brings extra overhead, such as data transfer time and energy consumption. These extra overheads may significantly impact the efficiency and payload of UAV-based delivery systems. Therefore, taking the UAV last-mile delivery system with MEC as an example, this article investigates the energy-aware multi-UAV task computation management problem according to a realistic autonomous delivery network (ADNET). Specifically, we propose a computation management strategy, namely, the MEC-based task offloading and scheduling strategy (TOSS), to provide an integral approach covering both the static task offloading and scheduling algorithm, as well as the dynamic resource conflict resolution algorithm. Grounded on real-world scenarios, our experimental results show that TOSS can achieve a higher payload for UAVs by using minimum energy consumption and task makespan within the given constraints of the deadline compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The specific operation defined in the studied ConOps focuses on a UAS administering a 'targeted aerial application' of agricultural chemicals to small, pre-determined areas of crops in large fields. Applying UAS to agriculture in this manner is very realistic since it is a relatively minimal risk operation compared to other potential UAS commercial operations and presents significant value to the agricultural community.

The integration of UAVs with Internet of Things (IoT) systems further amplifies their functionality, enabling sophisticated applications such as smart city management and environmental monitoring. In this context, blockchain technology plays a pivotal role by providing a decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger that facilitates secure data exchange between UAVs and connected devices. Its transparent and immutable characteristics mitigate the risk of a single point of failure, thereby enhancing data integrity and bolstering trust within UAV-IoT communication networks. However, the interconnected nature of these systems introduces significant security challenges, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and a variety of network-based attacks. These issues are further compounded by the limited computational capabilities of IoT devices and the inherent vulnerabilities of wireless communication channels. Recently, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme using blockchain was presented; however, our analysis identified several critical security flaws in these existing protocols, such as drone impersonation and session key disclosure. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a secure and lightweight authentication scheme for multi-server UAV-IoT environments. The proposed protocol effectively mitigates emerging security threats while maintaining low computational and communication overhead. We validate the security of our scheme using formal methods, including the Real-Or-Random (RoR) model and BAN logic. Comparative performance evaluations demonstrate that our protocol enhances security while also achieving efficiency, making it well-suited for resource-constrained IoT applications.

Unmanned aerial vehicles with a camera properly steered by a pilot are able, to some extent, to replace a jimmy jib/crane and a dolly; basic technical devices, used in the studios, enabling the creation of narrative systems of pictures in film and television. Television is more and more often using drone footage to report events, broadcast live, as well as create coverage and television documentaries. In many productions, the pilot of the drone simultaneously acts as the drone camera operator, which can improve the effectiveness of shooting, but also carries some risks related to flight safety. The article describes and presents in the form of processed footage the real conditional ties of a Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) flight faced by pilots filming with a drone. VLOS is a type of air operation, which requires maintaining eye contact with the drone. In many countries, a drone visibility flight is legally sanctioned as VLOS Operation. An experiment was conducted to investigate the interactions between a human and a machine in airspace steered using a controller with a touchscreen. The drone pilot was considered an integral part of the drone's flight system control Experimental data was collected with the use of a mobile eye-tracker, video cameras, surveys, and pilot declarations. During the experiment, eight television drone pilot operators recaptured a model shot under the regime of VLOS flight at low altitudes. They all show that both advanced and beginner pilots did not look at the UAV for over half the time of shot execution. The experiment allowed establishing two coefficients related to the effectiveness of a VLOS flight aiming at filming from the drone. The results point to clear differences in screen perception styles used by drone television pilots. The coefficients were described in the form of mathematical formulas and their limit values were determined. The research also determines the limits of pilots' perception, within which they can film with a drone. The outcomes may help to optimize the process of aerial filming with the use of a drone, carried out for television, film, and other media, as well as in a simulation of such a flight for research and training. From the perspective of media science and social communication, the presented study included a technological component that can be accessed through information science, using statistical models and variable distributions. Media scholars can study the impact of the media without having to look into the metaphorical black box. Computer science opens up this possibility.

Especially, UAVs are currently used not only in military fields but also in various private sectors such as IT, agriculture, logistics, construction, etc. The range is further expected to increase. Drone-related techniques need to evolve along with this change. In particular, there is a need for the development of an autonomous system in which a drone can determine and accomplish its mission even in the absence of remote control from a GCS (Ground Control Station). Responding to such requirements, there have been various studies and algorithms developed for autonomous flight systems. Especially, many ML-based (Machine-Learning-based) methods have been proposed for autonomous path finding. Unlike other studies, the proposed mechanism could enable autonomous drone path finding over a large target area without size limitations, one of the challenges of ML-based autonomous flight or driving in the real world. Specifically, we devised Multi-Layer HVIN (Hierarchical VIN) methods that increase the area applicable to autonomous flight by overlaying multiple layers. To further improve this, we developed Fisheye HVIN, which applied an adaptive map compression ratio according to the drone's location. We also built an autonomous flight training and verification platform.

However, due to the underactuation and load-swing problems caused by the dPDC, it is challenging to design controllers for a quadrotor with a suspended double-pendulum type payload. Existing related studies simplify the dPDC to a single-pendulum dynamic characteristic, which results in degraded transient performance. To overcome the issue, this article presents a novel controller approach that considers the real dynamic characteristics, that is, dPDC. The proposed approach tackles the quadrotor position control and anti-swing problem in two steps. First, a composite signal incorporating both the quadrotor position and the payload swing angles is introduced to restrain the payload swing. Second, a nonlinear controller based on the energy analysis method is proposed to overcome the coupling between rotation and translation, which addresses the underactuation problem. Theoretical analysis confirms the asymptotic stability of the system under this control strategy. Numerical and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

The mountainous environment of Fengshan County in Guizhou is first simulated as the UAV delivery environment. A differential evolution strategy based on the improved whale optimization algorithm ( DEIWOA) combined with multisource heterogeneous sensors is then proposed to solve the UAV obstacle avoidance path. After the UAV's delivery path is planned using the DEIWOA algorithm, the multisource heterogeneous sensor is used to perform obstacle avoidance among multiple UAVs and path correction of UAVs in actual situations. Afterwards, to minimize the delivery cost of UAVs, a multi-UAV cargo delivery model is built with the optimization goal of minimizing the transportation cost and time window violation cost. This UAV scheduling model is solved using the proposed DEIWOA algorithm. Finally, simulations are performed to compare the proposed method with the cutting-edge algorithms. The obtained results show that the proposed DEIWOA algorithm can provide a better plan of the UAV path and reduce the cost of logistics scheduling.

Conventional field methods are time-consuming and labor intensive, making them impractical for regional mapping and systematic monitoring. Gaps may be delineated using airborne lidar or aerial photographs acquired from a manned aircraft. However, high cost in data acquisition and low flexibility in flight logistics significantly reduce the accessibility of the approaches. To address these issues, this study utilized miniature light detection and ranging (lidar) onboard an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV(lidar)) to map forest canopy gaps of young and mature broadleaf forest plantations along the coast of northeastern Taiwan. This study also used UAV photographs (UAV(photo)) for the same task for comparison purposes. The canopy height models were derived from UAV(lidar) and UAV(photo) with the availability of a digital terrain model from UAV(lidar). Canopy gap distributions of the forests were modeled with the power-law zeta and Weibull distributions. The performance of UAV(lidar) was found to be superior to UAV(photo) in delineating the gap distribution through ground observation, mainly due to lidar's ability to detect small canopy gaps. There were apparent differences of the power-law zeta distributions for the young and mature forest stands with the exponents lambda of 1.36 (1.45) and 1.71 (1.61) for UAV(lidar) and UAV(photo), respectively, suggesting that larger canopy gaps were present within the younger stands. The canopy layer of mature forest stands was homogeneous, and the size distributions of both sensors and methods were insensitive to the spatial extent of the monitored area. Contrarily, the young forests were heterogeneous, but only UAV(lidar) with the Weibull distribution responded to the change of spatial extent. This study demonstrates that using the Weibull distribution to analyze canopy gap from high-spatial resolution UAV(lidar) may provide detailed information of regional forest canopy of coastal broadleaf forests.

In situ measurements are constrained in their spatial distribution by both logistics and costs. Satellite- and manned aircraft-based remote sensing provide spatially broad data, but often of a coarse resolution. Furthermore, all these data collection methods are often limited in their ability to respond to specific short-term events when the data and imagery could inform real-time assessment and decision-making, especially during and immediately after natural disasters. Researchers and regulators are increasingly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fill these gaps in both spatial and temporal data resolution. UAVs are often more cost-effective than traditional remote sensing or in situ data collection methodologies and the availability of new advancements in UAV design, power supply, payload capacity, and sensors has been driving rapid innovations in their use in the hydrological sciences. This in-depth review explores these UAV technologies and how they are being employed for on-demand and cost-effective characterization, monitoring, assessment, and modeling of soil and water resources. Our discussion addresses both key opportunities and challenges in surface water and groundwater studies, land-atmosphere interaction studies, water management in agriculture and forestry, ecosystem monitoring, and hydrological modeling.

The upper model focuses on the macro network configuration, while the lower model focuses on the UAV traffic flow distribution. The twolayer Simulated Annealing (SA) is presented to deal with the iterative process of network topology and traffic flow balance allocation.

The results suggest that there is a positive correlation between the network overall length and the flow entropy, a negative correlation between the network overall length and the nonlinear coefficient. When the maximum transit time of UAV is 3, the comprehensive performance of network operation is optimal.

To ensure the sustainability of the logistics industry, the impact of environmental and social sustainability factors on logistics development needs to be considered. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)/drones are used in the logistics field because of their flexibility, low cost, environmental protection and energy-saving advantages, which can achieve both economic benefits and social benefits. This paper reviews 36 studies on UAVs applications in logistics from the Web of Science database from the past two years (2021-2022). The selected literature is classified into theoretical models (the traveling salesman problem and other path planning problems), application scenarios (medical safety applications and last-mile delivery problems) and other problems (UAV implementation obstacles, costs, pricing, etc.). Finally, future directions of UAVs are proposed, such as different application scenarios that can be considered and different algorithms that can be combined to optimize paths for UAVs to specific flight environments.

Considering the limit of cruising range, from the perspective of green routing, a multi-package distribution path planning model of UAV agricultural logistics considering the limitation of cruising range of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was established to minimize total energy consumption. The task allocation was conducted according to the actual number of UAVs. Meanwhile, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model of task allocation was established. The improved ant colony algorithm was employed to solve the problem. The core idea was to exchange the pheromones of each ant subgroup, and subsequently to apply the insertion-based heuristic method and crossover and inversion operations to optimize the path. For the cases of remote areas in western China, the agricultural UAV distribution path planning considering the mileage limit contributes to saving resources and obtaining the lowest energy consumption distribution path. In addition, for the problem of agricultural logistics distribution path planning considering the mileage limit of UAV, the improved ant colony algorithm exhibits higher solution accuracy than the traditional ant colony algorithm.

{"TI": "A Survey of Recent Extended Variants of the Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", "DE": "UAVs; optimization problems; TSP; VRP", "AB": "The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed-through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features-are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones-the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.

Since commercial unmanned aerial vehicles have fundamental limitations on payloads and battery capacities, hybrid ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle models have been actively investigated as practical solutions. However, these studies have focused on linehaul (delivery) demands, excluding a large number of backhaul (pickup) demands. If we consider both demands at the same time, an empty unmanned aerial vehicle that finished linehaul service can be immediately used to serve a backhaul customer. In this study, we investigate the differences that arise by considering backhauls as an additional element of the routing problem. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed, and a heuristic is constructed to solve large-scale problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we compare it to existing models using a real-world example.

A review of accomplishments and challenges", "DE": "detection; drone; remotely piloted aerial vehicles; survey; wildlife", "AB": "1. Regular monitoring of animal populations must be established to ensure wildlife protection, especially when pressure on animals is high. The recent development of drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) opens new opportunities. UASs have several advantages, including providing data at high spatial and temporal resolution, providing systematic, permanent data, having low operational costs and being low-risk for the operators. However, UASs have some constraints, such as short flight endurance. 2. We reviewed studies in which wildlife populations were monitored by using drones, described accomplishments to date and evaluated the range of possibilities UASs offer to provide new perspectives in future research. 3. We focused on four main topics: 1) the available systems and sensors; 2) the types of survey plan and detection possibilities; 3) contributions towards anti-poaching surveillance; and 4) legislation and ethics. 4. We found that small fixed-wing UASs are most commonly used because these aircraft provide a viable compromise between price, logistics and flight endurance. The sensors are typically electro-optic or infrared cameras, but there is the potential to develop and test new sensors. 5. Despite various flight plan possibilities, mostly classical line transects have been employed, and it would be of great interest to test new methods to adapt to the limitations of UASs. Detection of many species is possible, but statistical approaches are unavailable if valid inventories of large mammals are the purpose. 6. Contributions of UASs to anti-poaching surveillance are not yet well documented in the scientific literature, but initial studies indicate that this approach could make important contributions to conservation in the next few years. 7. Finally, we conclude that one of the main factors impeding the use of UASs is legislation. Restrictions in the use of airspace prevent researchers from testing all possibilities, and adaptations to the relevant legislation will be necessary in future.

{"TI": "Application of Postprocessing Kinematic Methods with UAS Remote Sensing in Forest Ecosystems", "DE": "digital forestry; UAS; PPK; GCP; forest inventory; aerial survey; remote sensing", "AB": "Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) serve as an excellent remote-sensing platform to fulfill an aerial imagery data collection niche previously unattainable in forestry by satellites and manned aircraft. However, for UAS-derived data to be spatially representative, a precise network of ground control points (GCP) is often required, which can be tedious and limit the logistical benefits of UAS rapid deployment capabilities, especially in densely forested areas. Therefore, methods for efficient data collection without GCPs are highly desired in UAS remote sensing. Here, we demonstrate the use of postprocessing kinematic (PPK) technology to obtain subcentimeter precision in datasets of forested areas without the need for placing GCPs. We evaluated two key measures, positional variability and time efficiency, of the PPK technology by comparing them to traditional GCP methods. Results show that PPK displays consistently higher positional precision than traditional GCP approaches. Moreover, PPK surveys and processing take less time to complete than traditional GCP methods and require fewer logistical steps, especially in image acquisition. The time and resource savings with PPK as compared to GCP processing are undeniable. We conclude that PPK technology provides a practical means to produce precise aerial forest surveys. Study Implications: Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have enormous potential for lowering costs and streamlining practices in the forestry management and research community. Despite this potential, however, UAS forestry applications have been limited in scope and precision because of a reliance on using ground-based GPS technology to survey ground control points (GCP), which are time intensive and require an open view of the sky. Such a need for a ground-based GCP survey, along with forest canopy serving to limit and scatter incoming GPS signals, diminishes the potential for rapid deployment and precision mapping offered by UAS. Fortunately, Postprocessing-Kinematic (PPK) GPS technology lowers these barriers by providing the means to seamlessly gather highly precise UAS imagery without needing to conduct time-intensive ground-based surveys. This study compares the precision and time-effectiveness between traditional GCP marker surveys and PPK correction methods.

The high-resolution, full-coverage landscape data offered by UAV-based survey would seem well suited to archaeological study in Central Asia; the region is characterized by a long history of fragmented land-use patterns, variegated cultural geography, and niche local environments. However, UAV survey strategies have not been widely incorporated in Central Asian archaeological research, and subsequently have not impacted interpretative processes in ways comparable to other regions. Part of the problem lies in the logistical challenges of coperating UAVs in the areas of remote (offline) and rough terrain typical of much of Central Asia, and to this methodological issue we offer some field-tested strategies developed in mountainous areas of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Another significant challenge to UAV-based survey in Central Asia lies in the ongoing development of landscape archaeology as both concept and practice in the region. We address this disciplinary problem by framing our discussion in the broader context of the gains and challenges UAV-generated datasets bring to the interpretation of Central Asian landscapes.

At present, research still needs to be done in the detection of complex subsurface structure under areas where landslides might occur, and the number of fast and reliable methods used to detect underground structures is limited. Conventional surface geophysical methods face logistical difficulties when carried out in areas with significant topography. The characteristics and distribution patterns of the electromagnetic field excited with loop and galvanic sources are compared and analyzed with numerical simulation, which can facilitate the instrument development and field survey configurations. A loop source semi -aerial transient electromagnetic (TEM) system based on rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed for the investigation of landslide geological hazards.

The input equivalent noise of the receiver is 0.5 mu V. The air receiving coil is a hollow coil with a frequency of 30 kHz and an equivalent area of 3100 m(2). The new equipment is used to carry out experimental research on the Faer landslide area located in Guizhou province. During the field test, the measured data of semi-airborne and surface TEM are compared and analyzed. The test results show that the newly developed semi-airborne TEM system is stable and reliable, and the geoelectric structure below the complex terrain could be quickly recovered from the measured data.

Various sUAS models and sensors are available with varying features and usefulness depending on survey goals. However, justification for selection of sUAS and sensors are not typically offered in published literature and existing reviews do not adequately cover past and current sUAS applications for animal monitoring nor their associated sUAS model and sensor technologies, taxonomic and geographic scope, flight conditions and considerations, spatial distributions of sUAS applications, and reported technical difficulties. We outline a systematic map protocol to collect and consolidate evidence pertaining to sUAS monitoring of animals. Our systematic map will provide a useful synthesis of current applications of sUAS-animal related studies and identify major knowledge clusters (well-represented subtopics that are amenable to full synthesis by a systematic review) and gaps (unreported or underrepresented topics that warrant additional primary research) that may influence future research directions and sUAS applications. Methods: Our systematic map will investigate the current state of knowledge using an accurate, comprehensive, and repeatable search. We will find relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as dissertations and theses using online publication databases, Google Scholar, and by request through a professional network of collaborators and publicly available websites. We will use a tiered approach to article exclusion with eligible studies being those that monitor (i.e., identify, count, estimate, etc.) terrestrial vertebrate animals. Extracted data concerning sUAS, sensors, animals, methodology, and results will be recorded in Microsoft Access. We will query and catalogue evidence in the final database to produce tables, figures, and geographic maps to accompany a full narrative review that answers our primary and secondary questions.

{"TI": "Unmanned Aerial Survey of Elephants", "AB": "The use of a UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) was tested to survey large mammals in the Nazinga Game Ranch in the south of Burkina Faso. The Gatewing x 100 (TM) equipped with a Ricoh GR III camera was used to test animal reaction as the UAS passed, and visibility on the images. No reaction was recorded as the UAS passed at a height of 100 m. Observations, made on a set of more than 7000 images, revealed that only elephants (Loxodonta africana) were easily visible while medium and small sized mammals were not. The easy observation of elephants allows experts to enumerate them on images acquired at a height of 100 m. We, therefore, implemented an aerial strip sample count along transects used for the annual wildlife foot count. A total of 34 elephants were recorded on 4 transects, each overflown twice. The elephant density was estimated at 2.47 elephants/km(2) with a coefficient of variation (CV%) of 36.10%. The main drawback of our UAS was its low autonomy (45 min). Increased endurance of small UAS is required to replace manned aircraft survey of large areas (about 1000 km of transect per day vs 40 km for our UAS). The monitoring strategy should be adapted according to the sampling plan. Also, the UAS is as expensive as a second-hand light aircraft. However the logistic and flight implementation are easier, the running costs are lower and its use is safer. Technological evolution will make civil UAS more efficient, allowing them to compete with light aircraft for aerial wildlife surveys.

Since then, UAVs have quickly gained traction as a feasible option for last-mile operations in transport and logistics. In the context of this research, we construct a mathematical framework aiming to depict the collaborative interaction between trucks and drones in coordinating pickup and delivery tasks with the objective of minimizing operational costs. The drone-assisted pickup and delivery problem (DAPDP) is a variant of the problem in which a single truck departs a depot with parcels and a UAV on board. As the truck picks up packages and makes deliveries, the UAV can also be used to make deliveries to customers near the truck's position. As the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) embarks on its delivery task, the truck continues on its route, making further deliveries along the way and retrieving the UAV at another customer location different from the launch point. The model is presented as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), and a novel heuristic solution approach based on the classic Clarke-Wright savings heuristic is proposed. Our heuristic's efficacy is evaluated in comparison to a scenario involving only trucks, with a comprehensive series of numerical experiments conducted to underscore the advantages of incorporating UAVs into the pickup and delivery problem. Finally, we perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of key drone parameters in order to demonstrate their impact.

However, the detection, tracking, and geolocation of moving vehicle based on the airborne platform suffer from small object sizes, complex scenes, and low-accuracy sensors. To address these problems, this paper develops a framework for moving vehicle detecting, tracking, and geolocating based on a monocular camera, a GPS receiver, and inertial measurement units (IMUs) sensors. First, the method based on YOLOv3 was employed for vehicle detection due to its effectiveness and efficiency for small object detection in complex scenes. Then, a visual tracking method based on correlation filters is introduced, and a passive geolocation method is presented to calculate the GPS coordinates of the moving vehicle. Finally, a flight control method in terms of the previous image processing results is introduced to lead the UAV that is following the interesting moving vehicle. The proposed scheme has been built on a DJI M100 platform on which a monocular camera and a microcomputer Jetson TX1 are added. The experimental results show that this scheme is capable of detecting, tracking, and geolocating the interesting moving vehicle with high precision. The framework demonstrates its capacity in automatic supervision on target vehicles in real-world experiments, which suggests its potential applications in urban traffic, logistics, and security.

This research focuses on the efficiency of autonomous (driverless) air and ground delivery vehicles in terms of vehicle-miles, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Three types of autonomous vehicle are analyzed: drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs), and road autonomous delivery robots (RADRs). The CO2 emissions of these autonomous vehicles are compared against emissions from an electric van (e-van), a conventional internal combustion engine van, and driving to a store utilizing electric and conventional vehicles. The impacts of vehicle capacity, range, and time constraints are analyzed as well as the impacts of number of deliveries, service time, area of service, and depot-service area distance. Novel results are found regarding the efficiency of each vehicle type and tradeoffs between driving to a store and store delivery as a function of order size and type of vehicle driven by consumers.

The safe navigation of drones in such environments is a major challenge that requires sophisticated algorithms and systems, that can quickly and efficiently estimate the situation, find the shortest path to the target, and detect and avoid obstacles. Traditional path planning algorithms are unable to handle the dynamic and uncertain nature of real environments, while traditional machine learning models are insufficient due to the constantly changing conditions that affect the drone location and the location of obstacles. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been widely used for autonomous navigation problems, however, computational complexity and energy demands of such methods can become a bottleneck to the execution of UAV flights. In this paper, we propose the use of a minimum set of sensors and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for the safe and efficient navigation of drones in urban and rural environments. Our approach considers the complex and dynamic nature of such environments by incorporating real-time data from low-cost onboard sensors. After performing a thorough review of the existing solutions in drone path planning and navigation in 3-D environments, we experimentally evaluate our proposed approach in a simulated environment, and in various scenarios. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RL-based approach in the navigation of drones in complex and unconstrained environments. The implemented approach can serve as a basis for the development of advanced and robust navigation systems for drones, which can improve safety and efficiency in transportation applications in the near future.

The resulting routine use of underpowered designs could lead to a systematic underestimation of insecticide effects on nontarget arthropod communities. We tested the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for experimental insecticide applications at tree level to increase replication in cost-efficient way. We assessed the effects of two forestry insecticides, diflubenzuron (DFB) and tebufenozide (TBF), on the oak defoliator, Thaumetopoea processionea (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), and on nontarget, tree-living Lepidoptera. Individual trees were sprayed with either insecticide or left unsprayed, in a fully factorial design involving 60 trees. Caterpillars fallen from tree crowns were sampled as a measure of mortality, while caterpillar feeding activity was monitored by collecting frass droppings. Both DFB and TBF led to greater mortality of T. processionea and lower Lepidoptera feeding activity than control levels. TBF caused measurable mortality in nontarget groups, affecting Macrolepidoptera more strongly than Microlepidoptera, while there was no significant side effect of DFB. The high treatment efficacy against the target pest indicates that UAV technology is well-suited for the application of insecticide in forests. We detected distinct responses to different insecticides among nontarget groups and suggest there is an influence of application timing and biological traits in these differences, emphasizing the need for more ecologically orientated risk assessment. UAV-supported designs can be used to link laboratory bioassays and large-scale experiments, allowing for more comprehensive assessments of insecticide effects in forest ecosystems.

An extensive review of related literature was conducted to identify specific evaluation criteria tailored to each task. The UAV evaluation problem has been divided into three sub-problems, and an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed within a Pythagorean Fuzzy environment for evaluation. The Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method was employed to determine criteria weights.

As a key issue in industrial environment perception, the accurate robot localization can enhance their autonomous ability and is an important branch of robotic studies in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new method for cooperative autonomous localization among air-ground robots in a wide-ranging outdoor industrial environment. The aerial robot first maps an area of interest and achieves self-localization. Then the aerial robot transfers a simplified orthogonal perspective 2.5-D map to the ground robots for collaboration. Within the collaboration, the ground robot achieves pose estimation with respect to the unmanned aerial vehicle pose by instantaneously registering a single panorama with respect to the 2.5-D map. The 2.5-D map is used as the spatial association among air-ground robots. The ground robots estimate the orientation using automatically detected geometric information and generates the translation by aligning the 2.5-D map with a semantic segmentation of the panorama. Our method effectively overcomes the dramatic differences between the air-level view and the ground-level view. A set of experiments is performed in the outdoor industrial environment to demonstrate the applicability of our localization method. The proposed robotic collaborative localization outperforms most consumer sensor in accuracy and also has an outstanding running time.

However, it lacks the spectral range and precision to profile materials and organisms that only hyperspectral sensors can provide. This kind of high-resolution spectroscopy was firstly used in satellites and later in manned aircraft, which are significantly expensive platforms and extremely restrictive due to availability limitations and/or complex logistics. More recently, UAS have emerged as a very popular and cost-effective remote sensing technology, composed of aerial platforms capable of carrying small-sized and lightweight sensors. Meanwhile, hyperspectral technology developments have been consistently resulting in smaller and lighter sensors that can currently be integrated in UAS for either scientific or commercial purposes. The hyperspectral sensors' ability for measuring hundreds of bands raises complexity when considering the sheer quantity of acquired data, whose usefulness depends on both calibration and corrective tasks occurring in pre- and post-flight stages. Further steps regarding hyperspectral data processing must be performed towards the retrieval of relevant information, which provides the true benefits for assertive interventions in agricultural crops and forested areas. Considering the aforementioned topics and the goal of providing a global view focused on hyperspectral-based remote sensing supported by UAV platforms, a survey including hyperspectral sensors, inherent data processing and applications focusing both on agriculture and forestrywherein the combination of UAV and hyperspectral sensors plays a center roleis presented in this paper. Firstly, the advantages of hyperspectral data over RGB imagery and multispectral data are highlighted. Then, hyperspectral acquisition devices are addressed, including sensor types, acquisition modes and UAV-compatible sensors that can be used for both research and commercial purposes. Pre-flight operations and post-flight pre-processing are pointed out as necessary to ensure the usefulness of hyperspectral data for further processing towards the retrieval of conclusive information. With the goal of simplifying hyperspectral data processingby isolating the common user from the processes' mathematical complexityseveral available toolboxes that allow a direct access to level-one hyperspectral data are presented. Moreover, research works focusing the symbiosis between UAV-hyperspectral for agriculture and forestry applications are reviewed, just before the paper's conclusions.

People no longer go to the ground floor to receive a postal package. In the meantime, the delivery of postal packages through the balconies and windows of the units on the upper floors of the buildings will gradually become inevitable. Hence, a new Vehicle Routing Problem with Drone mathematical model has been developed with the objective of minimizing total delivery time and with the ability to deliver postal packages in the path of drones at different heights. In addition, the drone's energy consumption is computed by taking into account wind speed, the weight of the postal parcel, the weight of the drone's body, and other factors in the drone's path. A two-phase algorithm based on the nearest neighborhood and local search is presented to solve the developed mathematical model in different instances. Several small-sized test problems are designed and solved, and the performance of the heuristic approach is evaluated compared to the outputs of the CPLEX solver. Finally, the proposed model is implemented on a real-world scale to demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed model as well as the heuristic approach.

This research focuses on the complex challenges of planning UAV routes in high-risk environments, where real-time adjustments to flight strategies are often necessary to ensure mission success and the safety of the UAVs. As a case study, we consider scenarios involving UAVs delivering essential aid to vulnerable groups in unsafe areas, which presents unique logistical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a novel model based on Safe Path Prioritization, which emphasizes the selection of previously flown and confirmed safe paths over sending UAVs into unknown, potentially dangerous areas. Our innovative approach combines two advanced tools for efficient route planning: Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) for effective pathfinding and a genetic algorithm-based mechanism for optimizing routes. Additionally, the model utilizes a dynamic risk map to enhance decision-making, ensuring that UAVs aim to visit the closest beneficiary groups while accounting for critical constraints such as battery consumption. The proposed method was rigorously validated through extensive computer simulations, which varied configurations, including the number of beneficiary groups, UAVs, and unsafe zones. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in operational effectiveness: specifically, there was a 28% increase in the number of beneficiary groups visited and a remarkable 71% increase in successful deliveries, even under less favorable conditions that necessitated longer flight paths. Conversely, in scenarios deemed less challenging, UAVs tended to reduce visits to beneficiary groups, prioritizing safer but lengthier routes. Overall, our findings illustrate that Safe Path Prioritization is a reliable and effective method for completing missions where both UAV preservation and timely aid delivery to beneficiary groups are of paramount importance.

However, there is no literature yet addressing a comprehensive assessment of them. To bridge this research gap, this paper aimed to compare UAVs to SUGVs in the context of urban parcel delivery from a practical, conceptual, technological, commercial, and environmental perspective. Methodology: Based on structured literature and web research, this paper provided a comparative status quo review of these two delivery concepts. We introduced a parameter-based cost calculus model to estimate the costs per shipment for each technology. To detect the key cost drivers, we applied a one-way sensitivity analysis, as well as a \"full factorial design of experiment\" approach. Results: These key cost drivers for both operations are the \"number of vehicles per operator\" and the \"average beeline service radius\". From today's commercial point of view, our model indicated better profitability of SUGVs. However, technical and regulatory developments may render different results in the future. As SUGVs emit significantly less noise than UAVs, we assume that SUGVs have an additional advantage for usage in autonomous urban last mile delivery from a resident's perspective. Conclusions: Both key cost drivers will significantly influence the commercial viability of unmanned home delivery services. Safety and security aspects will determine regulatory rules on \"number of vehicles per operator\". To increase the \"average beeline service radius\", UAVs could profit from mothership delivery concepts while SUGV delivery may co-use existing public transport infrastructure.

In this paper, we consider an air-andground cooperative wireless network that enables dynamic coverage to support the flexible scheduling of the automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) in the IWLS. Jointly considering the dynamic deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as the adaptive power control of AGVs, we formulate a two time-scale network control problem to minimize the transmission power consumption of all AGVs under their individual rate requirement. On large time scales, we first propose a particle swarm optimization based algorithm (PSOA) to obtain the deployment position of the ABS. Then, using the results of the PSOA as training data, we design a deep neural network (DNN) framework aimed at reducing the computational time of the PSOA. On small time scales, we devise an online power control algorithm (OPCA) by using some of stochastic network optimization methods. With current channel conditions, the OPCA can generate the real-time power control policy and ensure the longterm rate requirement. Numerical simulations indicate that the DNN framework enhances the coverage performance of the network only consuming a few milliseconds of computation time. Incorporated with the OPCA, the total transmission power of the AGVs is significantly reduced. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many logistics companies are planning to realize real-time delivery services through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, costs of running such an autonomous delivery system are too expensive. Fortunately, urban management departments (UMD) that are responsible for monitoring urban environments have the intentions to cooperate with external companies and design crowdsensing methods, so that the duty can be ensured in an autonomous and low-cost method. Motivated by this, instant delivery UAVs are introduced into crowdsensing, so that UAVs can earn additional money for logistics companies while ensuring priority completion of instant deliveries, as well as provide environmental monitoring data to UMD. To be specific, some challenges are firstly identified to combine these two tasks based on real-world data in China. Then a set of data-driven UAVs sharing algorithms is proposed to achieve sensing for urban POIs (Points of Interest) and urban anomaly events. The results of simulations based on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our methods. The average sensing interval of the POIs within a 368.64 pi km(2) area can be only approximate to 2.6 min. more than 81% of stochastic events are successfully predicted, over 84% (401 out of 476) of events are successfully sensed, and 60% of events have a UAV to arrive within 6 . 65 min of their occurrence.

The use of drones could drastically decrease labour costs and has been hyped as a potential disruptor to the parcel delivery industry. Online retailers and delivery companies such as Amazon, are already filing up patents for the development of multi-level fulfilment centres for unmanned aerial vehicles or drone-beehives that would allow the deployment of this technology within built environment. A substantial amount of research has been carried out in the last years on the potential use of drones for parcel delivery, principally in the area of logistic optimisation. However, little is known about the potential market and economic viability of such services in Europe. This paper presents a modelling framework using EU-wide high-resolution population and land-use data to estimate the potential optimal location of drone-beehives based on economic viability criterion. It estimates the potential number of EU28 citizens that could potentially benefit from last mile-drone delivery services under four scenarios. The performed analyses indicates that under the scenario considered as the most technologically realistic, up to 7% of EU citizens could get access to such services. When considering technological improvements scenarios, the share reaches 30%. Furthermore, results suggest that due to the differences in population and land-use patterns in the different Member States, the potential drone coverage across Europe could be very heterogeneous, with the UK, Germany, Italy and France appearing as the most likely countries where drone-beehives may have the most efficient development.

One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantly reduced their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios.

Given a set of agricultural tasks to be performed at specific locations, we formulate a multi-Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to define the optimal assignment of these tasks to the robots as well as the respective optimal paths to be followed. The optimality criterion aims to minimize the total time required to execute all the tasks, as well as the cumulative execution times of the robots. Costs for travelling from one location to another, for maneuvering and for executing the task as well as limited energy capacity of the robots are considered. In addition, we propose a sub-optimal formulation to mitigate the computational complexity by leveraging the fact that generally in PA settings only a few locations require agricultural tasks in a certain period of interest compared to all possible locations in the field. A formal analysis of the optimality gap between the optimal and the sub-optimal formulations is provided. The effectiveness of the approach is validated in a simulated orchard where three heterogeneous aerial vehicles perform inspection tasks. Note to Practitioners-This paper aims at providing an efficient solution to PA needs by deploying a team of robots able to perform agricultural tasks at given locations in large-scale orchards. In particular, a novel general optimization problem is proposed that, given a set of mobile and possibly heterogeneous robots and a set of agricultural tasks to carry out, defines the assignment of these tasks to the robots as well as the routes to follow, while minimizing the total and the cumulative execution times of the robots. Existing approaches for route optimization in PA generally involves complete coverage of the field by one or multiple robots and do not account for maneuvering costs with general layouts of the field. We consider costs for travelling from one location to another, for executing the task and for maneuvering without any restriction on the layout of the plants as well as we take into account the limited energy capacity of the robots. We also provide a sub-optimal formulation which reduces the computational burden by relaxing the optimization of the maneuvering costs at the locations where agricultural tasks are carried out and formally derive the optimality gap. The proposed approach is flexible and can be easily adapted to any PA setting involving multiple mobile robots that are required to accomplish given tasks in an area of interest. We validate its effectiveness in a realistic simulated setup composed of three heterogeneous aerial vehicles performing inspection tasks. In future research, we aim to design algorithms to solve the proposed optimization problems in an efficient manner as well as to validate the formulations on real-world robotic platforms.

Typically, two key stages in the deployment of such a system are resource selection and scheduling. Here, we endeavor to conduct both of these phases in concert for persistent UAV operations. We develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to formally describe this joint design and scheduling problem. The MILP allows UAVs to replenish their energy resources, and then return to service, using any of a number of candidate service station locations distributed throughout the field. The UAVs provide service to known determin-istic customer space-time trajectories. There may be many of these customer missions occurring simultaneously in the time horizon. A customer mission may be served by several UAVs, each of which prosecutes a different segment of the customer mission. Multiple tasks may be conducted by each UAV between visits to the service stations. The MILP jointly determines the number and locations of resources (design) and their schedules to provide service to the customers. We address the computational complexity of the MILP formulation via two methods. We develop a branch and bound algorithm that guarantees an optimal solution and is faster than solving the MILP directly via CPLEX. This method exploits numerous properties of the problem to reduce the search space. We also develop a modified receding horizon task assignment heuristic that includes the design problem (RHTA(d)). This method may not find an optimal solution, but can find feasible solutions to problems for which the other methods fail. Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the RHTA(d) and branch and bound methods relative to the MILP solved via CPLEX. For the experiments conducted, the branch and bound algorithm and RHTA(d) are about 500 and 25,000 times faster than the MILP solved via CPLEX, respectively. While the branch and bound algorithm obtains the same optimal value as CPLEX, RHTA(d) sacrifices about 5.5 % optimality on average.

{"TI": "Impact of UAV Delivery on Sustainability and Costs under Traffic Restrictions", "AB": "Compared with traditional vehicles delivery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which benefits environmental sustainability. Besides, UAVs can overcome traffic restrictions, which are the big obstacle in parcel delivery. In reality, there are two kinds of most popular traffic restrictions, vehicle-type restriction, and half-side traffic. We propose a mixed-integer (0-1 linear) green routing model with these two kinds of traffic restrictions for UAVs to exploit the environmental aspects of the use of UAVs in logistics. A genetic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the complex routing problem, and an experimental analysis is made to illustrate and validate our model and the algorithm. We found that, under both these two traffic restrictions, UAV delivery can accomplish deliveries that cannot be carried out or are carried out at much higher costs by vehicles only and can always effectively save costs and cut CO(2)emissions, which is environmentally friendly. Furthermore, UAV delivery saves more cost and cuts more CO(2)emission under the first kind of traffic restriction than that under the second.

UAVs mainly communicate with mobile base stations, ground stations (GS), or networked peer UAVs, known as UAV swarms. UAVs communicate with GS, or UAV swarms, over wireless channels to support mission-critical operations. Communication latency, bandwidth, and precision are of prime importance in such operations. With the rise of data-driven applications, fifth-generation (5G) networks would face bottlenecks to communicate at near-real-time, at low latency and improved coverage. Thus, researchers have shifted towards network designs that incorporate beyond 5G (B5G) networks for UAV designs. However, UAVs are resource-constrained, with limited power and battery, and thus centralized cloud-centric models are not suitable. Moreover, as exchanged data is through open channels, privacy and security issues exist. Federated learning (FL) allows data to be trained on local nodes, preserving privacy and improving network communication. However, sharing of local updates is required through a trusted consensus mechanism. Thus, blockchain (BC)-based FL schemes for UAVs allow trusted exchange of FL updates among UAV swarms and GS. To date, limited research has been carried out on the integration of BC and FL in UAV management. The proposed survey addresses the gap and presents a solution taxonomy of BC-based FL in UAVs for B5G networks due to the open problem. This paper presents a reference architecture and compares its potential benefits over traditional BC-based UAV networks. Open issues and challenges are discussed, with possible future directions. Finally, a logistics case study of BC-based FL-oriented UAVs in 6G networks is presented. The survey aims to aid researchers in developing potential UAV solutions with the key integrating principles over a diverse set of application verticals.

This paper proposes an exact analytical approach and operational strategy to the logistics of any pandemic vaccination efforts, applicable both to sparsely populated areas or deficient infrastructure, and to very dense urban fabrics where mobility is highly constrained. Our strategy consists in dividing the territory concerned into zones and districts in a concentric way. We opt for the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to free ourselves from land constraints. This involves serving, from a logistics centre (central depot), any number n of vaccination centres, while optimizing costs and deadlines. We have determined all equivalent and optimal flight path plans for a fixed and optimal number of drones, which depend on domain D(d); d being the demand of vaccination centers.

In a pandemic, drone-based delivery is a promising and highly efficient method to reduce transportation time, cost, and exposure to infection. However, owing to both the limited battery lifetime and the limited functions of UAV in-flight missions, it is difficult to implement multiple deliveries over long distances in a single transportation mission. In this article, we study how to extend the drone flight time with charging stations and ensure multiple deliveries in a single mission. For multiple long-distance deliveries, optimization methods are required to design the delivery area networks of customers, charging stations, and delivery routes. We propose a joint routing and charging strategy (JRCS) comprising three phases to perform multiple deliveries in a single mission. We first split the customers of a delivery area using a clustering algorithm according to their distance from the nearest charging station and the maximum flight range. The second phase provides flight segmentation and intersegment routes between the depot, customer locations, and charging stations based on the maximum flight range and safe flight distance. The joint consideration of drone routes with charging stations minimizes the number of charging stations and ensures safe delivery. Finally, we formulate mixed-integer linear programming to solve the drone delivery route problem. According to simulation results, the proposed JRCS outperforms existing delivery approaches in terms of various performance metrics.

This paper introduces the vessel-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) routing problem with multiple visits in a single flight (VURP-M), a novel logistical model that addresses aimed at enhancing the replenishment of offshore platforms with small, essential items. The VURP-M allows the UAV to perform multiple visits during a single flight, optimising the delivery process. To tackle the VURP-M, we propose two mixed-integer second-order cone programs that capture the problem's complexities. Given its NP-hard nature, we employ an adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) method, featuring a segmented initialisation process and problem-specific operators guided by a rule-based mechanism to improve solution efficiency. The ALNS formulates an initial solution by solving a travelling salesman problem to create a giant tour, which is then used to group sequential targets into multiple UAV flights. The subsequent optimal resolution of a SOCP determines the take-off and landing points for each flight. Subsequently, the ALNS refines the initial solution through destroy and repair operators, enhancing the search for superior sequences and allocation schemes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a real-world case study and numerical experiments on random instances featuring up to 100 platforms.

The time during which electric vans are carrying robots can be used to recharge the robots, thereby increasing the efficiency of the distribution system.

Focusing on the new time-distance-energy trade-off problem, which increases the difficulty checking the feasibility of any given route, we further propose a greedy route evaluation approach and a linear programming-based route evaluation method. An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is presented for solving larger instances. A sensitivity analysis for vehicle charging modes, charging rates, and maximum battery capacities shows that using en-route charging, while appropriately increasing battery level and charging rate can have useful effects on cost.

Different types of nonlinear state estimation are deployed to test the position estimation of drones by treating the information from AirSim as offline dynamic data. The obtained global positioning system sensor data and magnetometer sensor data are determined as the measurement model. The experiment in the simulation is separated into (1) the localization state, (2) the rendezvous state, in which the proposed rendezvous strategy is presented by using the relation between velocity and displacement through the setting area, and (3) the full mission state, which combines both the localization and rendezvous states. The localization state results show the best RMSE in the case of full GPS available at 0.21477 m and 0.25842 m in the case of a GPS outage during a period of time by implementing the ensemble Kalman filter. Similarly, the ensemble Kalman filter performs well with an RMSE of 0.5112414 m in the rendezvous state and demonstrates exceptional performance in the full mission state. Moreover, the experiment is implemented in a real-world situation with some basic drone kits as proof that the proposed rendezvous strategy can truly operate.

Based on the analysis, this paper concludes with a set of recommendations for the effective employment of drones, including fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships and streamlining the approval process for emergency drone flights. This study emphasizes the need for collaborative regulatory frameworks and best practices to maximize the potential of drone technology in aiding those in distress.

When users are interested in sensory data in certain areas covered by UAV networks, they can send a spatio-temporal range query with time and geography constraints through the ground station. For example, obtaining the temperature information around fire points in the forest within an hour before the fire bursts out. Then, UAVs that carry the query results will return the data to the ground station through multi-hop routing. However, most of the existing spatio-temporal range query algorithms are designed for static networks. How to conduct spatio-temporal range queries in the UAV networks is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a Trajectory-Aware Spatio-Temporal range query processing algorithm (TAST) for UAV networks. The ground station takes advantage of the pre-planned trajectory information of UAVs to build the topology change model of the UAV network, which can reflect the changes of UAVs' communication links and neighbors. Furthermore, the static topology change graph (TCG) is proposed for optimizing the routing of query results in the spatio-temporal query processing. Next, we propose a Trajectory-Aware Spatio-Temporal range query processing algorithm based on packet Splitting (TASTS), which is used to split large query results into multiple small packets called unit packets, and each unit packet is transmitted back to the ground station independently and efficiently. Finally, we evaluated our algorithms through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that TAST and TASTS perform well in terms of query success rate, query efficiency and overhead ratio.

Whereas, most of the existing logistics UAV delivery models have not taken the energy consumption of the logistics UAVs and mixed time windows of the customers, which leads to their models cannot be applied in practical transportation systems. Therefore, we propose to minimize the total energy cost of multiple logistics UAVs during the customized products delivery period for a smart transportation system. Taking the energy consumption variation of the logistics UAVs, mixed time windows of the customers, as well as simultaneous delivery and pick up into consideration, we formulate a cooperative path planning problem via jointly optimizing the route of the logistics UAVs and the service allocation. To solve this large-scale integer programming problem, we employ the Large Neighborhood Search Algorithm (LNS) to accelerate the convergence rate of Genetic Algorithm (GA), and then develop an improved GA based cooperative path planning algorithm (IGCPA). The optimization procedure of the proposed algorithm IGCPA is divided into two phases, using the GA crossover operator and variational operator in the global search phase and LNS operator in the local search phase, and validating the integer programming model and the effectiveness of the solution algorithm based on different scale cases. Finally, abundant simulation results show that the energy cost of IGCPA is reduced by 17.35%, 15.18% and 9.99% compared with GA, LNS and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), respectively. Furthermore, the IGCPA is validated using Solomn standard data, which further verifies that the IGCPA can enhance the convergence rate of GA as well as obtain a lower delivery cost. Sensitivity analysis of the maximum UAV load and battery capacity reveals that the distribution cost tends to decrease and then increase as the increase of maximum load and battery capacity.

Manual measurements tend to be accurate but are invasive and logistically challenging to obtain. Ground-based photogrammetric techniques are less invasive, but inherent limitations make them impractical for many field applications. The recent proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in wildlife monitoring has provided a promising new platform for the photogrammetry of free-ranging pinnipeds. Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are an apex predator in coastal Antarctica whose body condition could be a valuable indicator of ecosystem health. We aerially surveyed leopard seals of known body size and mass to test the precision and accuracy of photogrammetry from a small UAS. Flights were conducted in January and February of 2013 and 2014 and 50 photogrammetric samples were obtained from 15 unrestrained seals. UAS-derived measurements of standard length were accurate to within 2.01 +/- 1.06%, and paired comparisons with ground measurements were statistically indistinguishable. An allometric linear mixed effects model predicted leopard seal mass within 19.40 kg (4.4% error for a 440 kg seal). Photogrammetric measurements from a single, vertical image obtained using UAS provide a noninvasive approach for estimating the mass and body condition of pinnipeds that may be widely applicable.

With the disruptive transformation of artificial intelligence technology, autonomous trajectory planning based on intelligent algorithms has emerged as a key technique for enhancing UAVs' capacity for autonomous behavior, thus holding significant research value. To address the challenges of UAV trajectory planning in complex 3D environments, this paper proposes a multi-UAV cooperative trajectory-planning method based on a Modified Cheetah Optimization (MCO) algorithm. Firstly, a spatiotemporal cooperative trajectory planning model is established, incorporating UAV-cooperative constraints and performance constraints. Evaluation criteria, including fuel consumption, altitude, and threat distribution field cost functions, are introduced. Then, based on its parent Cheetah Optimization (CO) algorithm, the MCO algorithm incorporates a logistic chaotic mapping strategy and an adaptive search agent strategy, thereby improving the home-returning mechanism. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted using a considerably large test dataset containing functions with the following four characteristics: unimodal, multimodal, separable, and inseparable. Meanwhile, a strategy for dimensionality reduction searching is employed to solve the problem of autonomous trajectory planning in real-world scenarios. The results of a conducted simulation demonstrate that the MCO algorithm outperforms several other related algorithms, showcasing smaller trajectory costs, a faster convergence speed, and stabler performance. The proposed algorithm exhibits a certain degree of correctness, effectiveness, and advancement in solving the problem of multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning.

However, most such robots are task-specific and generally lack the versatility to tackle multiple scenarios, terrains, and unstructured, dynamic environments. This paper presents the Omnirotor platform, a versatile, multi-modal, coaxial, tilt-rotor, all-terrain vehicle that combines an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) into a hybrid, all-terrain vehicle. The Omnirotor has two locomotion modes of operation (aerial and ground vehicle) and five operational configurations, as it can fly both in the Normal and Inverted configurations and drive on the ground in the Normal and Inverted configurations. It can also recover from any non-operational state to its Normal, upside-down configuration. Moreover, in addition to the locomotion modes, the continuous omnidirectional thrust vectoring enables the Omnirotor platform to perform complex manipulation of objects. This work introduces the concept and discusses in detail the design, development, and experimental validation of the Omnirotor platform. In particular, it discusses the modeling and control schemes required by the different operation modes and configurations. It experimentally validates the platform's capabilities with experiments focusing on traversing challenging environments and unstructured, uneven terrains (e.g., a public park). Finally, the platform's ground, pushing-based manipulation capabilities are demonstrated through the execution of a puzzle-solving experiment where the solved puzzle serves as a landing platform for the all-terrain vehicle. The versatility of the Omnirotor offers exciting prospects for use in challenging search-and-rescue scenarios, surveillance, and aerial and ground manipulation applications.

The customers can be served by either a truck or a drone within the respective time window of each. Each capacitated truck carries drones that can be launched to perform deliveries. The drone takes off from a truck located either at a customer or at the depot and it must land on the same truck after visiting a customer to be served. The aim is to serve all customers at minimum cost, under time window, capacity, and flying endurance constraints. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and develop a heuristic procedure where a two-phase strategy is embedded in a multi-start framework. The computational results are carried out on instances generated by starting from vehicle routing problem with time windows benchmarks. We analyze the behavior of the considered transportation system by mean of the solutions provided by the MILP. The proposed formulation is able to solve instances with up to 15 customers.

As the public transportation network is actually a stochastic time-dependent network, we focus on the reliable drone path planning problem (RDPP). We present a stochastic model to characterize the path traversal time and develop a label setting algorithm to construct the reliable drone path. Furthermore, we consider the limited battery lifetime of the drone to determine whether a path is feasible, and we account this as a constraint in the optimization model. To accommodate the feasibility, the developed label setting algorithm is extended by adding a simple operation. The complexity of the developed algorithm is analyzed and how it works is demonstrated via a case study.

The logistics company is required to control the risk of epidemic spreading while delivering goods to residents. In this case, the logistics company often uses vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for delivery. This paper studies the distribution issue of cold chain logistics by integrating UAV logistics with epidemic risk management innovatively. At first, a \"vehicle-UAV\" joint distribution mode including vehicles, small UAVs and large UAVs, is proposed. The green cost for vehicles and UAVs is calculated, respectively. The formula for infection risk due to large numbers of residents gathering at distribution centers to pick up goods is then derived. Furthermore, based on the control of infection risk, an optimization model is developed to minimize the total logistics cost. A modified ant colony algorithm is designed to solve the model. The numerical results show that the maximum acceptable risk and the crowd management level of distribution centers both have significant effects on the distribution network, logistics cost and number of new infections. Our study provides a new management method and technical idea for ensuring the needs of residents during the epidemic.

Drone-truck combined operation (DTCO) solutions are based on vehicle routes and drone launch and retrieval locations, usually customer nodes. Since a perfect synchronization of both vehicles is very rare, most of the solutions obtained after designing combined delivery routes generally contain time losses, caused by the need for the first vehicle that reaches the meeting point to wait until the arrival of the other. In this paper, a pseudo node insertion method is proposed to make DTCO solutions more efficient by improving the truck-drone synchronization operations. To this end, starting from a given routing solution, pseudo nodes are created at the point where a drone and a truck can meet simultaneously. We present a detailed method to calculate the location of the pseudo nodes and provide a detailed analysis of the conditions that allow us to reduce the travel completion time for different route patterns. Furthermore, we explore a variety of scenarios to illustrate the efficiency of the pseudo node insertion method for different DTCO problem solutions. An algorithm for the pseudo node insertion method is provided, and numerical examples are presented to discuss the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

However, their communications are prone to both channel errors and eavesdropping. Hence, we investigate the max-min secrecy fairness of UAV-aided cellular networks, in which Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) aided downlink transmissions are employed by each multi-antenna UAV Base Station (UAV-BS) to safeguard the downlink of a two-user Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system against an external multi-antenna Eavesdropper (Eve). Realistically, only Imperfect Channel State Information (ICSI) is assumed to be available at the transmitter. Additionally, we consider a realistic total power constraint and guarantee the specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the legitimate users. To handle the worst-case channel uncertainty of the legitimate users and an external Eve, we conceive a robust secure resource allocation algorithm, which maximizes the minimum worst-case secrecy rate of the legitimate users. Based on the CRS principle, the transmitter splits and encodes the messages of legitimate users into common as well as private streams and the user having stronger CSI is asked to help the cell-edge user by opportunistically forwarding its decoded common message. In contrast to the existing schemes adopted in the literature for ensuring secure transmission of the first cooperative phase only, in our proposed solution the common message has a twin-fold mission. Explicitly, apart from serving as the desired message, it also acts as Artificial Noise (AN) for drowning out Eve without consuming extra power. This is in stark contrast to the conventional AN designs. In the second phase, the pure AN is directed towards the Eve, deploying a robust Maximum Ratio Transmitter (MRT) beamformer at the UAV-BS. To solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem we resort to the Sequential Parametric Convex Approximation (SPCA) method together with a bespoke initialization algorithm to avoid any failure due to infeasibility. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed secure transmission scheme outperforms the existing cooperative benchmarkers.

Most prominent potential advantages of drone delivery are cost savings, high speed, and high flexibility. Additionally, drones are also considered as a means of green transportation as they are electric vehicles which are potentially emission-free. To which extent these claimed potentials exist depends on the application scenario as well as the environmental and technological conditions. In this study a stationary drone delivery system is considered where parcels are delivered from a central depot to customers either by drone or electric truck. The minimal total energy consumption for serving all customers is determined when using only an electric truck or a mixed fleet of electric trucks and drones. In a simulation study the effects of structural characteristics (like numbers of customers and customer density) and environmental conditions (like wind speed and traffic conditions) on potential energy savings using drones are estimated. The results indicate that structural characteristics and environmental conditions heavily affect the energy saving potential of drones. In urban settings with high customer density, the energy saving potential is limited to at most 1% while in rural settings drones can help to save 5% of total energy. Under drone-favoring conditions like calm winds and heavy traffic, the energy saving potential can double.

A key part of this analysis utilizes computer algorithms, such as Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Thresholding and Blob detection, to develop a multi-camera image recognition system for freight transport management and logistics in smart cities. The objective is to design a system that optimizes the route planning and time of vehicle passage on selected road sections, ultimately leading to the reduction of emissions. During the study, data obtained from multiple sources were compared, and the analysis uncovered different results for the same assumptions. We discuss the reasons for these variances. Overall, the results obtained in the analysis indicated that it is necessary to correct the predictions of the multi-camera image recognition system with additional methods and algorithms.

These challenges are intensified due to drone performance limitations and various uncertainties in supply chain operations. While recent literature recognises the potential of drones for last-mile delivery, it falls short in effectively considering these uncertainties in drone-enabled supply chain models. Our research addresses this gap with two major contributions: first, a novel stochastic mixed-integer programming model is developed to construct a feasible delivery network, including warehouses and recharging stations, enhancing both coverage and reliability. Second, a modification in the genetic algorithm by considering each scenario independently improves computational efficiency, outperforming commercial software by an average of 40% and up to 55%. Empirical findings reveal that strategic investments in system hardening can yield substantial improvements in reliability. Despite the absence of real-world stochastic parameters as a limitation, this research pioneers the design of reliable networks under uncertainties and extends drone coverage through strategic charging stations. This work sets a significant milestone for future optimization in drone logistics, offering practical implications for supply chain managers considering drone adoption.

This study presents a methodology to select the optimal window size of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract texture features from UAV images for FHB detection. Host conditions and the disease distribution were combined to construct the model, and its overall accuracy, sensitivity, and generalization ability were evaluated. First, the sensitive spectral features and bands of the UAV-derived hyperspectral images were obtained, and then texture features were selected. Subsequently, spectral features and texture features extracted from windows of different sizes were input to classify the area of severe FHB. According to the model comparison, the optimal window size was obtained. With the collinearity between features eliminated, the best performance of the logistic model reached, with an accuracy, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90, 0.79, and 0.79, respectively, when the window size of the GLCM was 5 x 5 pixels on May 3, and of 0.90, 0.83, and 0.82, respectively, when the size was 17 x 17 pixels on May 8. The results showed that the selection of an appropriate GLCM window size for texture feature extraction enabled more accurate disease detection.

One of the most talked-about developments in recent years has been the potential use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, for transporting packages, food, medicine, and other goods. Delivery by drones offers new possibilities, but also induces new challenging routing problems. In this paper, we address and extend the so-called Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem. Basically, in this problem, deliveries are split between a vehicle and one or several drones. The vehicle performs a classical delivery tour from the depot, while the drones are constrained to perform back and forth trips. The objective is to minimize the completion time. We extend the problem by considering several vehicles. We call it Parallel Drone Scheduling Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic for its solution. The procedure starts by building a giant tour visiting all customers. Then, the giant tour is split in order to determine a set of vehicles tours (each vehicle tour following the order defined by the giant tour) and a set of customers assigned to drones. Thirdly, an improvement step move customers between vehicles or between vehicles and drones. We also propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation and a simple branch-and-cut approach. The proposed approach is validated via an experimental campaign on instances taken from the CVRPLIB1 library. Computational experiments comparing several variants of the hybrid metaheuristic give some insights on this drone delivery system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. C1 [Saleu, Raissa G.

However, for complex scenarios, UAV swarms are prone to environmental interference that damages their equipment or disrupts their communication links, affecting the normal execution of tasks. In this paper, an information-communication interdependent network model is designed for the vulnerability analysis of UAV swarm networks with emergency tasks. Firstly, from the perspective of network functions of a UAV swarm, we introduce the theory of interdependent networks to abstract the relationship between the UAV swarm's communication network and its information network, where the communication network represents its communication topology and the information network is related to the function of each UAV individual in the UAV swarm. Then, the vulnerability of the UAV swarm is analyzed according to the relationship between network construction costs and network connectivity under environmental interference. Finally, the effectiveness of the vulnerability analysis method is verified through simulation.

{"TI": "Vehicle and UAV Collaborative Delivery Path Optimization Model", "DE": "UAV; cooperative delivery; path optimization; genetic algorithm", "AB": "In the context of frequent public emergencies, emergency logistics distribution is particularly critical, and because of the unique advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the model of coordinated delivery of vehicles and UAVs is gradually becoming an essential form of emergency logistics distribution. However, the omission of start-up costs prevents the cost of UAV battery replacement and the sorting, assembly and verification of packages from being factored into the total cost. Furthermore, most existing models focus on route optimization and delivery cost, which cannot fully reflect the customer's desire for service satisfaction under emergency conditions. It is necessary to convert the unsatisfactory degree of time window into a penalty cost rather than a model constraint. Additionally, there is a lack of analysis on the mutual waiting cost between vehicles and UAVs when one of them is performing delivery tasks. Considering the effects of the time window, customer demand, maximum load capacity, and duration of distribution benefits, we propose a collaborative delivery path optimization model for vehicles and UAVs to minimize the total distribution cost. A genetic algorithm is used to obtain the model solution under the constraints of distribution subloops, distribution order, and take-off and landing nodes. To assess the efficacy of the vehicle and UAV collaborative delivery path optimization model, this paper employs a county-level district in Xi'an city as a pilot area for an emergency delivery. Compared with the vehicle-alone delivery model, the UAV-alone delivery model and vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model, this model can significantly reduce the utilization of distribution vehicles while also significantly lowering the start-up cost, waiting cost and penalty cost. Thus, the model can effectively improve delivery timeliness and customer satisfaction. The total cost of this model is 39.2% less than that of the vehicle-alone delivery model and 16.5% less than that of the UAV-alone delivery model. Although its delivery cost is slightly higher than the vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model, the reduction in the start-up cost and penalty cost decrease the overall cost of distribution by 11.8%. This suggests that to cut costs of all sizes and conserve half of the resources used by vehicles, employing the vehicle-UAV collaborative delivery model for emergency distribution is preferable. Moreover, the model integrating the start-up cost, penalty cost, waiting cost, etc., can more effectively express the requirements of timeliness for UAV delivery under emergency conditions.

We used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to follow and video-record 25 groups of mating dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) near the surface of the water and examine how behavior patterns varied with mating group type. We collected aerial footage of dolphins mating in traditional Isolated Pods and within Integrated Pods and compared differences in the number of mating animals, swimming speed, bearing change, percent time at the surface of the water, female respiration rate, copulatory position rate, and sex-specific mating behaviors. Only the mean number of mating animals and some sex-specific mating behaviors varied significantly between the two mating group types. More dolphins were engaged in mating behaviors in Isolated Pods than Integrated Pods. Males engaged in more interference behaviors in Isolated Pods compared to Integrated Pods. Females performed fewer speed bursts but more rolls on their backs in Integrated Pods compared to Isolated Pods. Several similarities and differences were found in comparison to boat-based research of the same population of dolphins.

Compared to traditional methods of forests monitoring which mostly use orthophotography from satellites or aircraft, there is very little research on the use of 3D canopy structure to monitor forest growth. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial could be a novel and feasible platform to generate more timely and high resolution forest 3D canopy images. In spring, the forest is supposed to experience rapid growth. In this research, we used a small UAV to monitor campus forest growth in spring at 2-day intervals. Each time, 140 images were acquired and the ground surface dense point cloud was reconstructed at high precision. Excess Green indexes (ExG) was used to extract the green canopy points. The segmented point cloud was triangulated using the greedy projection triangulation method into a mesh and its area was calculated. Forest canopy growth was analyzed at three levels: forest level, selected group level and individual tree level. A logistic curve was used to fit the time series canopy growth. Strong correlation was found R-2 = 0.8517 at forest level, R-2 = 0.9652 at selected group level and R-2 = 0.9606 at individual tree level. Moreover, high correlation was found between canopies. By observing these results, we can conclude that the ground 3D model can act as a useful data type to monitor forest growth. Moreover UAV aerial remote sensing has advantages when monitoring forests in periods when the ground vegetation is growing and changing fast.

UAV requires obstacle avoidance for safe flight and must adhere to various flight constraints, such as altitude changes and turning angles, during path planning. Excellent flight paths can enhance flight efficiency and safety, saving time and energy when performing specific tasks, directly impacting mission accomplishment. To address these challenges, this paper improves the original grey wolf algorithm (GWO). In this enhanced version, the three head wolves randomly assign influence weights to execute the position updating mechanism. A dynamic weight influence strategy is designed, which accelerates convergence in the late optimization stages, aiding in finding the global optimum. Meanwhile, the logistic mapping is introduced into the convergence factor, and a micro-vibrational convergence factor is constructed. This allows the algorithm to have a better ability to find a globally optimal solution in the search space while also being able to search deeper using areas near the currently known information. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, a simulated flight environment is established, conducting simulation experiments within safe flight environments featuring 5, 10, and 15 obstacles. Comparative analysis with seven other algorithms demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better superiority. In terms of path length on three maps, DLGWO paths are 10.3 km, 15.5 km, and 2.6 km shorter than the second-placed MEPSO, SOGWO, and WOA, respectively. Furthermore, the planned path in this study exhibits the smallest fluctuations in altitude and turning angles.

Technological advances have paved the way for last mile deliveries by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Yet, the limited range and capacity of UAVs remain a challenge. This makes the possibility of pairing drones with well-established means of transportation highly attractive. However, the optimization problem arising in joint delivery by truck and drone has only recently been considered in the literature. We develop a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) with two different time-oriented objective functions. Additionally, we introduce new valid inequalities based on problem properties to strengthen the linear relaxation. One type of valid inequalities is an extension of the well known subtour elimination constraints. As the number of these constraints grows exponentially with instance size, we provide a separation routine that identifies violated cuts in relaxed solutions to add them efficiently. We therefore derive the first branch-and-cut algorithm for the VRPD. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the competitiveness of our MILP formulation and to show the impact of different combinations of valid inequalities. We optimally solve instances with unrestricted drone ranges with up to 20 nodes and instances with range-limited drones with up to 30 nodes. These are significantly larger instance sizes than the previously known exact approaches are able to handle. In addition, we introduce a relaxation of the VRPD that provides good lower bounds in notable reduced run times. To provide managerial insights, we show that integrating truck drone tandems into transportation systems can not only lead to improvements regarding the speed of deliveries, but can also be used to reduce the fleet size without slowing down the delivery process and increasing the workload of truck drivers.

This uncertainty has propelled the adoption of UAVs across diverse sectors such as logistics, weather forecasting, security surveillance, and autonomous driving, where their ability to navigate autonomously is crucial. Recent advancements have leveraged deep learning for robust object detection and tracking, significantly enhancing data acquisition from aerial imagery and UAV-based applications. Despite numerous innovations, the critical issue of optimizing UAV trajectories in unknown environments remains largely unaddressed. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Instructed Reinforcement Q-Learning Algorithm (IR-QLA), which utilizes Received Signal Strength (RSS) as a dynamic reward metric to refine trajectory planning continuously. By integrating a unique instructed reinforcement principle, this method significantly accelerates the learning process, improving the UAVs' navigational efficiencies. Our findings demonstrate that IR-QLA not only surpasses traditional algorithms like Ant Colony and Particle Swarm Optimization in terms of convergence speed but also minimizes the path length and iteration counts needed for trajectory optimization. Future studies will explore alternative reward sources and advanced algorithms to further enhance the precision and speed of UAV trajectory planning, aiming to establish new benchmarks in the field.

The watermelon detection model, based on YOLOv8s and obtained using transfer learning, achieved a detection accuracy of 99.20%, demonstrating its potential for application in yield estimation. The panorama stitching and overlap partitioning based detection and counting method uses panoramic images as input and effectively mitigates the duplications compared with the video tracking based detection and counting method.

However, the integration of these methods is not widely explored for oil palm. There are three primary aims of the current study. We evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of SMOTE, Logistic Model Tree (LMT), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to address data imbalance problems for the assessment of the oil palm nutrients and chlorophylls status. The performance of the raw band and vegetation index (VI) extracted from the UAV in assessing leaf biochemical properties of mature oil palms is also addressed. Finally, we compare the competency of the spectral model retrieved from the spectroradiometer and UAV. In the study, nitrogen (N) treatments varying between 0 and 6 kg palm-1 were applied to mature Tenera palms. The integration of SMOTE with LMT and AdaBoost (LMT-SMOTEBoost) outperformed other approaches in classifying the leaf biochemical sufficiency status of mature oil palm. The VIs outperformed the raw band in discriminating the leaf biochemical properties at the canopy level. Both leaf and canopy spectral models obtained from spectroradiometer and UAV were comparable and produced good performance with balanced accuracy (BAcc) above 0.77. Using these techniques may provide palm oil plantation owners with a cost-effective way to monitor nutrient levels in palms more efficiently and comprehensively to ensure greater harvests and tree health.

Logistics companies face challenges to meet customers' expectations with high efficiency and reliability at a low cost. Hence, this paper investigates the dynamic truck-drone routing problem with scheduled deliveries and on-demand pickups (D-TDRP-SDOP) for an on-demand logistics system. Trucks and drones are deployed to serve a batch of deterministic deliveries and an uncertain set of pickup requests with deadlines subject to maximum working hour constraints. The drones can serve multiple requests per trip subject to load constraints and endurance capacity restrictions. The service provider aims to maximize the total profits by dynamic reassignment and recourse of the vehicles. We formulate the D-TDRP-SDOP problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a heuristic solution approach framework, consisting of an offline enhanced construction algorithm (OECA) and a segment-based heuristic, to solve the MDP. The comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach and the benefits of the model. Our model improves the total profits by 15% by considering on-demand requests, and the drone operations contribute to a 50% improvement in the acceptance rate of dynamic customer requests. Improved drone technology, such as a higher drone speed and a higher battery capacity, can enable the system to serve more on-demand requests and increase the final profits.

Here we demonstrate the utility of a low cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in measuring two-dimensional running kinematics from free-roaming giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) in the Free State Province, South Africa. We collected 120 Hz video of running giraffes, and calibrated each video frame using metatarsal length as a constant object of scale. We tested a number of methods to measure metatarsal length. The method with the least variation used close range photography and a trigonometric equation to spatially calibrate the still image, and derive metatarsal length. In the absence of this option, a spatially calibrated surface model of the study terrain was used to estimate topographical dimensions in video footage of interest. Data for the terrain models were collected using the same equipment., during the same study period. We subsequently validated the accuracy of the UAV method by comparing similar speed measurements of a human subject running on a treadmill, with treadmill speed. At 8 m focal distance we observed an error of 8% between the two measures of speed. This error was greater at a shorter focal distance, and when the subject was not in the central field of view. We recommend that future users maximise the camera focal distance, and keep the subject in the central field of view. The studied giraffes used a grounded rotary gallop with a speed range of 3.4-6.9 ms(-1) (never cantering, trotting or pacing), and lower duty factors when compared with other cursorial quadrupeds. As this pattern might result in adverse increases in peak vertical limb forces with speed, it was notable to find that contralateral limbs became more in-phase with speed. Considering the latter pattern and the modest maximal speed of giraffes, we speculate that tissue safety factors are maintained within tolerable bounds this way. Furthermore, the angular kinematics of the neck were frequently isolated from the pitching of the body during running; this may be a result of the large mass of the head and neck. Further field experiments and biomechanical models are needed to robustly test these speculations.

Unlike the vehicle routing problem, drone route design is challenging due to several operational signatures, such as speed optimization, multi-trip operation, and energy consumption estimation. Drone energy consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and payload. Moreover, the high speed of drones can significantly curtail the drone range, thereby limiting the efficiency of drone delivery systems. This paper addresses the trade-off between speed and flight range in a multi-trip drone routing problem with variable flight speeds (DRP-VFS). We propose a new model to specifically consider energy constraints using a nonlinear energy consumption model and treat drone speeds as decision variables. The DRP-VFS is initially formulated using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to minimize energy consumption. To solve large-scale instances, we propose a three-phase adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm and compare its performance with a commercial MIP solver. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of effectively identifying suboptimal solutions in practical scenarios. Furthermore, results indicate that operating drones at variable speeds leads to about 21% energy savings compared to fixed speeds, with advantages in cost savings and range extension.

A number of discrete problems on the construction of optimal substructures of network systems described in the form of various classes of graphs are NP-complete problems. In this case, the variability and dynamism of the structures of network systems lead to an additional complication of the search for solutions to discrete optimization problems. At the same time, for some subclasses of dynamic graphs that are used to model the structures of network system, conditions for the solvability of a number of NP-complete problems can be distinguished. This subclass of dynamic graphs includes prefractal graphs. This article investigates NP-complete problems on prefractal graphs: a Hamiltonian cycle, a skeleton with the maximum number of pendant vertices, a monochromatic triangle, a clique, and an independent set. The conditions under which it is possible to obtain an answer about the existence of and construct polynomial (when fixing the number of seed vertices) algorithms for finding solutions for some problems are identified.

This will enable a large number of applications spanning from remote surveillance to logistics, smarter cities and emergency aid in hazardous environments. In this context, an emerging problem is to track unauthorized small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) hiding behind buildings or concealing in large UAV networks. In contrast with current solutions mainly based on static and on-ground radars, this paper proposes the idea of a dynamic radar network of UAVs for real-time and high-accuracy tracking of malicious targets. To this end, we describe a solution for real-time navigation of UAVs to track a dynamic target using heterogeneously sensed information. Such information is shared by the UAVs with their neighbors via multi-hops, allowing tracking the target by a local Bayesian estimator running at each agent. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information gathering point-of-view, the UAVs plan their own trajectory by minimizing the posterior covariance matrix of the target state under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints. Our results show how a dynamic network of radars attains better localization results compared to a fixed configuration and how the on-board sensor technology impacts the accuracy in tracking a target with different radar cross sections, especially in non line-of-sight (NLOS) situations.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) as a technology attracted lots of attention in the literature. Various researches focused on different drone-based delivery approaches, but there are only a few articles dealing with drones as the elements of complex CL concepts. The goal of this paper is to evaluate different drone-based CL concepts. Based on the existing ideas of drone application in delivery, the main group of CL concepts and their variants are defined, which represents the main contribution of the article. The evaluation and ranking of concepts are performed from the aspect of all CL stakeholders and the defined set of criteria by applying measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution (MARCOS) multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) method in spherical fuzzy environment, which represents another contribution of the article. The results indicate that the potentially best CL concept, with the final score of 0.408, is the one that refers to the transformation of the logistics system into a two-echelon system with the implementation of micro-consolidation centers (MCCs), in which the delivery of goods to MCCs is realized with rail transportation mode and the last delivery phase with drones. It is followed by the concepts that imply MCCs, and rail transportation in the function of mobile depots for drone launching and MCCs and ground delivery vehicles (GDVs), with the final scores of 0.395 and 0.390, respectively.

In reality, the online retailing platform receives grocery orders and promises ultrafast delivery service to the customers via a two-echelon logistics and distribution network. The uncertain arrivals of the orders have a nontrivial negative effect on the performance of the whole delivery network, which has not been well studied in the literature. This paper investigates the parcel consolidation policy and the UAVs routes for the last-mile delivery from a transshipment site in a distribution network to the final customers. First, this study proposes a nonmyopia consolidation policy considering the upcoming grocery parcels with random arrival times to minimize the total delivery cost including the possible penalty cost due to the delivery delay to the customer. To make the problem tractable in the real-time computational setting, an approximation method based on Bayesian estimation is proposed to reduce a large number of random arrival scenarios of upcoming parcels to an expected scenario. The problem is then approached with a deterministic model under the expected scenario. Subsequently, a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm is developed to solve the model. In the algorithm, a novel decoding method is designed to evaluate the particles with respect to the constraints of the load and battery capacities of a UAV and a neighborhood search based on reinforcement learning is developed to improve the quality of the particles in the searching process. The experimental results based on a case study validate the performance of the proposed parcel consolidation approach and the UAV routing algorithm. Some findings are given based on the variations of benchmarks with different distributions of customer locations. The approaches and insights in this paper could be used as a reference for last-mile delivery by UAVs.

In this work, we present a novel optimization approach for designing forest fire monitoring systems that incorporate surveillance towers, monitoring balloons, and drone technology, which have gained popularity in recent years for monitoring, logistics, and civil applications. We develop a compact mixed-integer linear programming model that includes location decisions for multiple monitoring technologies and routing of drones among monitoring facilities to achieve the most extensive possible terrain coverage. Additionally, we propose a matheuristic algorithm that comprises six components: a solution procedure, perturbation procedures, local search procedures, a call to the general-purpose solver to solve a mixed-integer linear programming model, a global reset strategy, a local reset strategy, and an acceptance criterion. We test the proposed model and algorithm on a set of random instances and a real-life case study in Chile. While the proposed model can only solve small instances, the matheuristic can find good-quality solutions for all instances.

Caribou fences are of archaeological and ecological significance, yet sparsely distributed and increasingly at risk to wildfire. Costly remote field logistics requires efficient prior fence verification and rapid on-site documentation of structure and landscape context. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and very high- resolution (VHR) satellite imagery were used for detailed site recording and detection of coarse woody debris (CWD) objects under challenging Subarctic alpine woodlands conditions. UAVs enabled discovery of previously unknown wooden structures and revealed extensive use of CWD (n = 1745, total length = 2682 m, total volume = 16.7 m(3)). The methodology detected CWD objects much smaller than previously reported in remote sensing literature (mean 1.5 m long, 0.09 m wide), substantiating a high spatial resolution requirement for detection. Structurally, the fences were not uniformly left on the landscape. Permafrost patterned ground combined with small CWD contributions at the pixel level complicated identification through VHR data sets. UAV outputs significantly enriched field techniques and supported a deeper understanding of caribou fences as a hunting technology, and they will aid ongoing archaeological interpretation and time-series comparisons of change agents.

It mostly involves location of entrapped fire crew or people in between fire fronts, as well as, safely removing them away from the dangerous zone. Moreover, SaR is applied in evacuation of rural residential areas due to heavy smoke impacts, or fire front approaching. Experiences achieved during a field trial, in which unmanned aerial and ground vehicles were deployed and used in a simulated forest fire SaR scenario, are presented. For planning and running the field trial a number of parameters were taken into consideration; logistics, safety plan, contingency plan, different agencies cooperation, time frames and ethical issues. Advantages of using unmanned aerial and ground vehicles in SaR operations include capability of planning and monitoring the operations, integration with the manned resources, connectivity with command and control centers, as well as, coordination of the different unmanned aerial and ground vehicles' platforms. Significant increase of personnel safety is possible through the capabilities of air quality monitoring and search over dangerous areas. Current limitations include limited heat resistance of vehicles and limited flying capability in strong winds and turbulence. Failure of communications is also possible due to rough terrain (autonomy limitations). Against all the limitations, a number of unmanned vehicles already exist that can be adapted successfully for SaR operations in forest fires. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While many efforts have contributed to the fundamental success of atmospheric applications of multicopters in the past, several challenges remain, including limited measurable variables, possible response-delay in real-time observations, insufficient measurement accuracy, endurance of harsh conditions and tolerance towards interferences. To address these challenges and further fortify the applicability in diversified research disciplines, this study developed an optimized multicopter UAV sounding technique (MUST). The MUST serves as an integrated platform by combining self-developed algorithms, optimized working environments for sensors/monitors, and retrofitted sampling devices to probe a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. These variables of interest include meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind direction and speed), the chemical composition (speciated VOCs, CO, CO2, CH4, CO2 isotopologues, O-3, PM2.5, and black carbon), and the radiation flux, as well as visible and thermal images. The aim of this study is to achieve the following objectives: 1. to easily probe a comprehensive set of near-surface atmospheric variables; 2. to improve data quality by correcting for sensors' delay in real-time observations and minimizing environmental interferences; and 3. to enhance the versatility and applicability of aerial measurements by incorporating necessary hardware and software.

The post-disaster area is modeled in a complete graph, where each search location is represented by a vertex, and the edges are the shortest paths between destinations, with an associated weight, corresponding to the battery consumption to fly to a location. In addition, in the DSRP addressed here, a set of drones are deployed in a cooperative drone swarms approach to boost the search. In this context, a V-shaped formation is applied with leader replacements, which allows energy saving. We propose a computation model for the DSRP that considers each drone as an agent that selects the next search location to visit through a simple and efficient method, the Drone Swarm Heuristic. In order to evaluate the proposed model, scenarios based on the Beirut port explosion in 2020 are used. Numerical experiments are presented in the offline and online versions of the proposed method.

Determining the role of biological soil crust in the energy flow and logistics cycle in the desert ecosystem is one of the frontier areas of ecological restoration in arid and semi-arid areas. Obtaining biological soil crust information from drone images is an efficient, fast, and low-cost method. However, due to the scattered and uneven growth of biological soil crusts and the complexity of the field environment, it is difficult to accurately extract biological soil crusts. In view of this, this study used the improved UNet++ model to extract biological soil crusts based on UAV image data. Firstly, the optimal Epoch, Backbone, and Loss function are selected and trained based on the network structure of UNet++ model. Then, the improved UNet++ model proposed in this paper, which takes ResNeXt as the Backbone and Soft Cross-Entropy Loss+Dice Loss as the Loss Function, is obtained. Finally, the test results of UNet++, U-Net, LinkNet, FPN, and PSPNet are compared with the improved UNet++ model in this paper. The results showed that the improved UNet++ model had the best segmentation effect, and the precision, recall, F1-Score, and IoU were 0.9788, 0.9501, 0.9495, and 0.9309, respectively. UAV image biological soil crust recognition based on the improved UNet++ model in this paper can obtain high-precision extraction results, provide good data support for studying the development of biological soil crusts in arid areas, and provide a new method for precise segmentation of different features in arid areas.

Firstly, to align with reality, specific constraints of UAVs in motions, attitudes and altitudes, real-world threats such as radars and no-fly zones, and inter-UAV collisions are considered. Thus, multi-UAV path planning is transformed into a multi-objective constrained optimization problem. Accordingly, an improved nutcracker optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Through initializing with logistic chaotic mapping and the lens imaging inverse learning strategy, a more fit elite initialization population is produced to increase the efficiency of path planning. Furthermore, by adjusting adaptive parameters and integrating an improved sine-cosine search strategy, a balance between global exploration capability and local exploitation capability during path planning is achieved. Experimental results show that the improved nutcracker optimization algorithm surpasses other algorithms with respect to both convergence speed and convergence value, making it an effective method for multi-UAV path planning.

Logistics activities conducted to quickly provide appropriate aid supplies (relief goods) to people affected by disasters are known as humanitarian logistics (HL), and play an important role in terms of saving the lives of those affected. In the previous last-mile distribution of HL, supplies are transported by trucks and helicopters, but these transport methods are sometimes not feasible. Therefore, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transport supplies is attracting attention due to their convenience regardless of the disaster conditions. However, existing transportation planning that utilizes UAVs may not meet some of the requirements for post-disaster transport of supplies. Equitable distribution of supplies among affected shelters is particularly important in a crisis situation, but it has not been a major consideration in the logistics of UAVs in the existing study. Therefore, this study proposes transportation planning by introducing three crucial performance metrics: (1) the rapidity of supplies, (2) the urgency of supplies, and (3) the equity of supply amounts. We formulated the routing problem of UAVs as the multi-objective, multi-trip, multi-item, and multi-UAV problem, and optimize the problem with Q-learning (QL), one of the reinforcement learning methods. We performed reinforcement learning for multiple cases with different rewards and quantitatively evaluated the transportation of each countermeasure by comparing them. The results suggest that the model improved the stability of the supply of emergency relief supplies to all evacuation centers when compared to other models.

In addition to these circumstances, aid agencies in developing countries are often confronted with poor or non-existent infrastructure that is further disrupted in case of disasters, i.e., destroyed roads and debris-covered areas which hinder medical teams in reaching remote locations. As the supply via trucks and helicopters is not applicable in this situation, alternative means of transport have to be considered. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are receiving increased attention by humanitarian organizations as they can help overcoming last-mile distribution problems, i.e., inaccessibility to cut-off regions. This paper considers drone applications in last-mile distribution in humanitarian logistics and presents an optimization model for the delivery of multiple packages of lightweight relief items (e.g. vaccine, water purification tablets, etc.) via drones to a certain number of remote locations within a disaster prone area. The objective of the model is to minimize the total travelling distance (or time/cost) of the drone under payload and energy constraints while recharging stations are installed to allow the extension of the operating distance of the drone. The implementation of different priority policies is discussed. The model is solved as a mixed integer linear program and illustrated numerically with different scenarios.

Satellite imagery offers open-access global coverage but is restricted to forest-level analyses, due to its coarse spatial resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery can monitor phenology at the individual tree level by utilizing a centimeter-scale resolution. Two research objectives were identified for this study: (1) to derive phenological metrics at the individual tree level, using various vegetation indices (VIs); and (2) to assess the accuracy of automatic crown delineation in a diverse ecosystem. To achieve this, fourteen multi-spectral UAV flights were performed, and the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and chlorophyll index red-edge (CIre) to model seasonal phenology was assessed. A double logistic model was fitted on the VI observations for each individual tree, to derive the start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Individual tree crowns were delineated automatically using marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS), and the treetops were identified using a local maximum filter (LMF). Overall, the automatic segmentation performed well (F-score: 0.79, IoU: 0.58), with higher accuracies in single-species areas, while it underperformed in complex mixed forest structures. All VIs captured a strong seasonal signal for the deciduous trees and derived SOS and EOS estimates consistent with literature and ground observations. General phenological patterns included an early silver birch SOS, a quick beech budburst, and large within-species phenology variations for oak trees. Seasonal VI variation for coniferous evergreen trees was limited, and the resulting phenology estimates proved unreliable. In conclusion, these findings emphasize the capabilities of UAV imagery for individual tree crown phenology monitoring. However, they also show the difficulty of monitoring evergreen phenology with the commonly-used VIs and stress the need for further investigations.

Traditional manual sampling methods are labor-intensive and lack precision. This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model that utilizes unmanned aerial systems (UAS)-based multi-sensor data to predict Napa cabbage fresh weight. The model was developed using high-resolution RGB, multispectral (MSP), and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery collected throughout the 2020 growing season. The imagery was used to extract various vegetation indices, crop features (vegetation fraction, crop height model), and a water stress indicator (CWSI). The deep neural network (DNN) model consistently outperformed support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models, achieving the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.47 kg) during the mid-to-late rosette growth stage (35-42 days after planting, DAP). The model's accuracy improved with cabbage maturity, emphasizing the importance of the heading stage for fresh weight estimation. The model slightly underestimated the weight of Napa cabbages exceeding 5 kg, potentially due to limited samples and saturation effects of vegetation indices. The overall error rate was less than 5%, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Spatial analysis further revealed that the model accurately captured variability in Napa cabbage growth across different soil types and irrigation conditions, particularly reflecting the positive impact of drip irrigation. This study highlights the potential of UAS-based multi-sensor data and AI for accurate and non-invasive prediction of Napa cabbage fresh weight, providing a valuable tool for optimizing harvest timing and crop management. Future research should focus on refining the model for specific weight ranges and diverse environmental conditions, and extending its application to other crops.

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are sought as a means to fulfill this need, especially leveraged by photogrammetric and LiDAR-based mapping methods and technology. The present study compares different strategies to carry UAS photogrammetric corridor mapping over linear extensions of sandy shores. In particular, we present results on the coupling of a UAS with a mobile laser scanning system, operating simultaneously in Cap Ferret, SW France. This aerial-terrestrial tandem enables terrain reconstruction with kinematic ground control points, thus largely avoiding the deployment of surveyed ground control points on the non-stable sandy ground. Results show how these three techniquesmobile laser scanning, photogrammetry based on ground control points, and photogrammetry based on kinematic ground control pointsdeliver accurate (i.e., root mean square errors < 15 cm) 3D reconstruction of beach-to-dune transition areas, the latter being performed at lower survey and logistic costs, and with enhanced spatial coverage capabilities.

Then, improved nonlinear dynamic inertia weights (INDIW) are introduced into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and when the particles fall into the local optimum, the velocity is perturbed, and the velocity and improved nonlinear dynamic inertia weight PSO (VAINDIWPSO) algorithm are obtained. The algorithm improves the speed of convergence and fitness function value of the PSO algorithm. However, the impact of flyable path optimization is now not obvious. Therefore, to further enhance the overall performance of the VAINDIWPSO algorithm, the adaptive adjustment of the velocity is introduced, the chaotic initialization is carried out, and the improved logistic chaotic map is introduced into the algorithm, and an improved chaotic-VAINDIWPSO (IC-VAINDIWPSO) algorithm is obtained. Then, the corresponding relationship between the algorithm and constraints is used to efficiently search complicated environments and find paths with excessive security and small cost function. The simulation outcomes exhibit that in a complicated environment the IC-VAINDIWPSO algorithm substantially improves the speed of convergence of the algorithm, reduces the fitness function value of the algorithm and the initialization time of the algorithm, and the acquired path is additionally smoother.

Using UAVs can achieve much more speedy, cost-effective, and environment-friendly delivery on an urban scale. However, UAVs suffer from insufficient delivery range and battery aging. This paper presents an innovative logistics UAV scheduling framework using public buses, in which logistics UAVs Land and Recharge its battery on Buses (ULRB) to extend its delivery range and decelerate its fading battery capacity. This work correlates physical layer parameters such as the energy consumption rate, the parcels weight, UAV velocity, the battery temperature to the UAV's path planning, the battery discharging, and the capacity fading models. Specifically, the ULRB framework consists of a single-UAV scheduling module and a multi-UAV dispatching module. In the single-UAV module, a Markov-based algorithm is utilized to plan the UAV's flying path to land and dynamically get recharged on the bus. The latter module optimized the delivery progress in a multi-UAV, multi-parcel, and multi-bus scenario. Finally, using a large-scale real-world bus trajectory dataset, extensive evaluations are conducted to verify ULRB. The results show that ULRB can extend the UAV's delivery range by 5.54x and decelerate the battery aging by 3.26x on average, up to 7.73x and 4.16x in extreme cases. With superior performance, ULRB is envisioned to open up a new direction towards enabling the application of logistics UAVs in smart cities.

{"TI": "Multi-Objective Algorithm for Blood Supply via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to the Wounded in an Emergency Situation", "AB": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in many industries. In the medical environment, especially in some emergency situations, UAVs play an important role such as the supply of medicines and blood with speed and efficiency. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-objective blood supply by UAVs in such emergency situations. This is a complex problem that includes maintenance of the supply blood's temperature model during transportation, the UAVs' scheduling and routes' planning in case of multiple sites requesting blood, and limited carrying capacity. Most importantly, we need to study the blood's temperature change due to the external environment, the heating agent (or refrigerant) and time factor during transportation, and propose an optimal method for calculating the mixing proportion of blood and appendage in different circumstances and delivery conditions. Then, by introducing the idea of transportation appendage into the traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), this new problem is proposed according to the factors of distance and weight. Algorithmically, we use the combination of decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and local search method to perform a series of experiments on the CVRP public dataset. By comparing our technique with the traditional ones, our algorithm can obtain better optimization results and time performance.

{"TI": "Autonomous Flightworthiness Determination for Modular Vertical Lift Vehicles", "AB": "Payload transportation via connected modular unmanned aerial vehicles is an emerging new area that offers unique advantages over other forms of aerial logistics. When considering rigidly attached, modular, vertical lift, unmanned aerial vehicles, differing payloads and vehicle attachment geometries have a significant effect on the composite aircraft's dynamic response during takeoff and stabilization. With no prior knowledge of payload parameters or vehicle attachment geometry, there is no inherent flightworthiness guarantee for a specific connected configuration. Onground flightworthiness determination can be used to ensure acceptable performance during vehicle takeoff or to prescribe changes to the vehicle attachment geometry if necessary. This paper introduces an algorithm to determine flightworthiness while in partial ground contact by estimating the vehicle attachment positions and payload weight. The algorithm uses a probabilistic estimate of vehicle placement about the payload derived through a Bayesian learning technique to generate the necessary data to deterministically estimate the attached vehicles' positions. Following a description of the algorithm, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm for a variety of modular aircraft configurations.

In the past, they have been manually protected and managed. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are already being applied in various fields, such as agriculture, surveying, and logistics, can be applied to automate this task. Image processing and machine learning techniques applied on images obtained from UAVs can automate Convallaria keiskei classification, help to estimate the increase in colony numbers, and reduce the detection cost. In a previous study, a flower number estimation method that combines image processing and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed. However, leaf regions similar to flower regions were misidentified as flower regions, and the accuracy was reduced. Therefore, in this study, a method was investigated to reduce the number of false positives by excluding areas similar to the flower regions. Specifically, a novel detection method combining image processing, CNN, and fuzzy c-means is proposed. To validate the proposed method, it was compared with the previous method as well as the method in which k-means was used instead of fuzzy c-means. All results were evaluated using flower distribution maps marked by field workers. The proposed method improved the F-measure by up to 22.0% compared with the previous method. Application of the proposed method to orthorectified images facilitates the understanding of flower populations over a wide range of areas, which can contribute to the conservation and management of the species.

A design parameter space approach is used to generate multiple feasible paths between a given set of waypoints with zero end curvature. The proposed methodology offers continuous upper curvature bounded paths, which are desirable for the bank angle limitation of unmanned aerial vehicles. A comparison with existing path-planning methods highlights the advantages in terms of inherent curvature continuity as well as analytic conditions for obstacle avoidance and confinement. Scenarios with multiple obstacles and waypoints are considered, and the solutions are validated on a realistic six-degree-of-freedom model of the Aerosonde unmanned aerial vehicle.

Most UAVs need to be manually controlled using remote control, which can be challenging in many environments. Therefore, autonomous UAVs have attracted significant research interest, where most of the existing autonomous navigation algorithms suffer from long computation time and unsatisfactory performance. Hence, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) UAV path planning algorithm based on cumulative reward and region segmentation. Our proposed region segmentation aims to reduce the probability of DRL agents falling into local optimal trap, while our proposed cumulative reward model takes into account the distance from the node to the destination and the density of obstacles near the node, which solves the problem of sparse training data faced by the DRL algorithms in the path planning task. The proposed region segmentation algorithm and cumulative reward model have been tested in different DRL techniques, where we show that the cumulative reward model can improve the training efficiency of deep neural networks by 30.8% and the region segmentation algorithm enables deep Q-network agent to avoid 99% of local optimal traps and assists deep deterministic policy gradient agent to avoid 92% of local optimal traps.

Given LE-UAVs' advantages of wide coverage, strong versatility and low cost, in addition to logistics distribution, they are widely used in military reconnaissance, communication relay, disaster monitoring and other activities. With limited autonomous intelligence, LE-UAVs require regular periodic and non-periodic control from ground control resources (GCRs) during flights and mission execution. However, the lack of GCRs significantly restricts the applications of LEUAVs in parallel. Design/methodology/approach - We consider the constraints of GCRs, investigating an integrated optimization problem of multi-LE-UAV mission planning and GCR allocation (Multi-U&G IOP). The problem integrates GCR allocation into traditional multi-UAV cooperative mission planning. The coupling decision of mission planning and GCR allocation enlarges the decision space and adds complexities to the problem's structure. Through characterizing the problem, this study establishes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the integrated optimization problem. To solve the problem, we develop a three- stage iterative optimization algorithm combining a hybrid genetic algorithm with local search-variable neighborhood decent, heuristic conflict elimination and post-optimization of GCR allocation. Findings - Numerical experimental results show that our developed algorithm can solve the problem efficiently and exceeds the solution performance of the solver CPLEX. For small-scale instances, our algorithm can obtain optimal solutions in less time than CPLEX. For large-scale instances, our algorithm produces better results in one hour than CPLEX does. Implementing our approach allows efficient coordination of multiple UAVs, enabling faster mission completion with a minimal number of GCRs. Originality/value - Drawing on the interplay between LE-UAVs and GCRs and considering the practical applications of LE-UAVs, we propose the Multi-U&G IOP problem. We formulate this problem as a MILP model aiming to minimize the maximum task completion time (makespan). Furthermore, we present a relaxation model for this problem. To efficiently address the MILP model, we develop a three-stage iterative optimization algorithm. Subsequently, we verify the efficacy of our algorithm through extensive experimentation across various scenarios.

However, regulations limiting drone operations to visual line of sight (VLOS) seriously affect the design of surveys, as flight paths must be concentrated within small sampling blocks. Such a design is inferior to spatially unrestricted randomized designs available if operations beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) are allowed. We used computer simulations to assess whether the VLOS rule affects the accuracy and precision of wildlife density estimates derived from drone collected data. We tested two alternative flight plans (VLOS vs. BVLOS) in simulated surveys of low-, medium- and high-density populations of a hypothetical ungulate species with three levels of effort (one to three repetitions). The population density was estimated using the ratio estimate and distance sampling method. The observed differences in the accuracy and precision of estimates from the VLOS and BVLOS surveys were relatively small and negligible. Only in the case of the low-density population (2 ind./100 ha) surveyed once was the VLOS design inferior to BVLOS, delivering biased and less precise estimates. These results show that while the VLOS regulations complicate survey logistics and interfere with random survey design, the quality of derived estimates does not have to be compromised. We advise testing alternative survey variants with the aid of computer simulations to achieve reliable estimates while minimizing survey costs.

However, deploying deep learning (DL)-based tracking algorithms on UAVs is challenging because of limitations in computing resources, battery capacity, and maximum load. Discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based trackers have become a popular choice in the UAV tracking community owing to their ability to provide superior efficiency while consuming fewer resources. However, the limited representation learning ability of DCF-based trackers leads to lower precision in complex scenarios compared to DL-based methods. Filter pruning is a prevalent practice for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with constrained resources, and it may be an effective way to solve problems encountered when deploying deep learning trackers on UAVs. However, the application of filter pruning to UAV tracking is underexplored, and a straightforward and useful pruning standard is desirable. This paper proposes using Fisher pruning to reduce the SiamFC++ model for UAV tracking, resulting in the F-SiamFC++ tracker. The proposed tracker achieves a remarkable balance between precision and efficiency, as demonstrated through exhaustive experiments on four popular UAV benchmarks: UAVDT, DTB70, UAV123@10fps, and Vistrone2018, showing state-of-the-art performance.

In this study, we analyzed the potential of different survey techniques to analyze hazards of the Forni Glacier, an important geosite located in Stelvio Park (Italian Alps). We carried out surveys in the 2016 ablation season and compared point clouds generated from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey, close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). To investigate the evolution of glacier hazards and evaluate the glacier thinning rate, we also used UAV data collected in 2014 and a digital elevation model (DEM) created from an aerial photogrammetric survey of 2007. We found that the integration between terrestrial and UAV photogrammetry is ideal for mapping hazards related to the glacier collapse, while TLS is affected by occlusions and is logistically complex in glacial terrain. Photogrammetric techniques can therefore replace TLS for glacier studies and UAV-based DEMs hold potential for becoming a standard tool in the investigation of glacier thickness changes. Based on our data sets, an increase in the size of collapses was found over the study period, and the glacier thinning rates went from 4.55 +/- 0.24ma(-1) between 2007 and 2014 to 5.20 +/- 1.11ma(-1) between 2014 and 2016.

Moreover, growth curve analysis and nonlinear mixed- effects models (NLME) are increasingly being used to study nonlinear crop responses in the context of repeated measurements. An NLME to fit the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on over-segmented UAV-imagery of a cassava experimental field is presented. To study the parameters' variability and error propagation, a resampling analysis and posterior NLME fit for different sample sizes were performed. High-resolution multispectral images (7 cm resolution) were captured in a cassava experimental field sown under optimal production conditions. NDVI for individual plants was dynamically calculated by performing a supervised classification based on over-segmented remote images using the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm for near infra-red-red-green bands. A three-parameter logistic function was adopted as a growth curve in function of growing degree days (degrees C) and fitted with an NLME approach. Inherent cassava NDVI variability due to pixel discretization, plant architecture and cassava growth was found. On average, NDVI values ranged from 0.35 to 0.40 for first development stages (295, 340 and 372 degrees C days) until 0.77 for maturity (1606 degrees C days). NDVI plant variability was correctly addressed considering the three parameters as random effects showing small root-mean-square error. Resampling analysis proved that a suitable accuracy parameter estimation can be performed with fewer individuals (plants) which might represent an agricultural experimental design with fewer experimental units. While the application of UAV imaging and nonlinear mixed models in determining NDVI curves is a relevant methodological framework, further research towards the optimization of experiment sample size is required.

Conventional hyperspectral techniques employed in mangrove monitoring are often limited to achieve the fine classification of mangrove species, due to the low spatial resolution of space-borne images and the high cost of airborne images. Moreover, using the spectral information alone is not adequate for fine-scale classification of mangrove species in complex ecosystems, because the spectral discriminability of mangrove species is generally restricted by complex canopy structures. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel mangrove species classification method that integratively uses unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based Nano-hyperspec hyperspectral imagery, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and the rotation forest (RoF) ensemble learning algorithm. The proposed method was tested in China's largest artificially planted mangroves, Qi'ao Island. First, we extracted spectral features from UAV-based hyperspectral data and structural information from LiDAR data; then we utilized the RoF algorithm to classify mangrove species based on the spectral and structural features and compared with two other popular ensemble learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF) and logistic model tree (LMT). Results showed that the combined hyperspectral and LiDAR data produced satisfactory results for all three classifiers with overall accuracy (OA) higher than 95%, and the proposed method achieved the highest OA of 97.22% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9686. Our study proved that incorporating the canopy height information can improve the classification accuracy, with the OA and Kappa coefficient being 2.43% and 0.0274 higher than using the original spectral bands alone, respectively. It is also found that the RoF algorithm is more accurate and stable in classifying mangrove species than those of RF and LMT. These findings indicated that the proposed approach could achieve fine-scale mangrove monitoring and further facilitate mangrove forest restoration and management.

However, due to the limited operational time and range of UAVs, achieving highly efficient coordinated actions is difficult, particularly in unknown dynamic environments. This paper proposes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based fusion-multiactor-attention-critic (F-MAAC) model for multiple UAVs' energy-efficient cooperative navigation control. The proposed model is built on the multiactor-attention-critic (MAAC) model, which offers two significant advances. The first is the sensor fusion layer, which enables the actor network to utilize all required sensor information effectively. Next, a layer that computes the dissimilarity weights of different agents is added to compensate for the information lost through the attention layer of the MAAC model. We utilize the UAV LDS (logistic delivery service) environment created by the Unity engine to train the proposed model and verify its energy efficiency. The feature that measures the total distance traveled by the UAVs is incorporated with the UAV LDS environment to validate the energy efficiency. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, the F-MAAC model is compared with several conventional reinforcement learning models with two use cases. First, we compare the F-MAAC model to the DDPG, MADDPG, and MAAC models based on the mean episode rewards for 20k episodes of training. The two top-performing models (F-MAAC and MAAC) are then chosen and retrained for 150k episodes. Our study determines the total amount of deliveries done within the same period and the total amount done within the same distance to represent energy efficiency. According to our simulation results, the F-MAAC model outperforms the MAAC model, making 38% more deliveries in 3000 time steps and 30% more deliveries per 1000 m of distance traveled.

In this study, we develop an optimization model to optimize the logistics for a fleet of drones for timely delivery of medical items (e.g., medicines, test kits, and vaccines) to hard-to-access locations (i.e., rural and suburban areas). We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand loca-tions. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments is performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY.

To deliver packages quickly and cost-effectively, the routes taken by UAVs from depots to customers must be optimized. We present an innovative, practical package-delivery model wherein multiple UAVs deliver multiple packages to customers, who are compensated for late deliveries. Further, we propose a novel methodology that combines a new plan-generation algorithm with a collective-learning heuristic to quickly determine cost-effective paths of UAVs, even for large-scale deliveries up to 10,000 customers. To demonstrate our methodology, we applied our highly flexible approach to a depot in Heathrow Airport, London. We show that our coordinated approach, in which the UAVs collectively determine their flight paths, leads to similar operational costs as those of the ant colony optimization technique and outperforms it for large-scale package deliveries.

The scheme offers 5G-tactile internet (5G-TI) based services for UAV communication networks (UAVCN) monitored through ground controller stations (GCs). 5G-TI enabled UAVCN supports real-time dense connectivity at ultra-low round-trip time (RTT) latency of < 1 ms and high availability of 99.99999%. Thus, it can support resilient vaccine distributions in a phased manner at government-designated nodal centers (NCs) with reduced round trip delays from vaccine production warehouses (VPW). Further, UAVCNs ensure minimizes human intervention and controls vaccine health conditions due to shorter trip times. Once vaccines are supplied at NCs warehouses, then the BC ensures timestamped documentation of vaccinated persons with chronology, auditability, and transparency of supply-chain checkpoints from VPW to NCs. Through smart contracts (SCs), priority groups can be formed for vaccination based on age, healthcare workers, and general commodities. In the simulation, for UAV efficacy, we have compared the scheme against fourth-generation (4G)-assisted long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, and traditional logistics for round-trip time (RTT) latency, logistics, and communication costs. In the BC setup, we have compared the scheme against the existing 5G-TI delivery scheme (Gupta et al.) for processing latency, packet losses, and transaction time. For example, in communication costs, the proposed scheme achieves an average improvement of 9.13 for block meta-information. For 4000 transactions, the proposed scheme has a communication latency of 16 s compared to 36 s. The packet loss is significantly reduced to 2.5% using 5G-TI compared to 16% in 4G-LTE-A. The proposed scheme has a computation cost of 1.6 ms and a communication cost of 157 bytes, which indicates the scheme efficacy against conventional approaches.

Traditional transect and helicopter counts are useful for obtaining population estimates, but they often have logistical and cost limitations. The recent proliferation of drone technology offers an innovative way of surveying animal populations. However, data collected from drones are hindered by an analysis bottleneck that increases the time needed to process them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an emerging category of deep learning that can automate this data analysis process. Here, we compare traditional methods with drone surveys, by detecting and counting Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) and common hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibious). We evaluate the utility of CNNs for object detection and quantification in complex environments. Drone counts were more accurate than traditional methods; identifying 21% more crocodiles. Where vegetation was open, hippo counts with a drone showed a similar pattern (identifying 43% more). When vegetation was dense the drone produced less-accurate population estimates than traditional methods. CNN accuracy was limited (85%) due to the reduced training dataset available for the CNN. However, with an expanded data set, object detection is likely to be more accurate, making it more applicable for expedited and automated data analysis.

Automatically classifying bird species by their vocalization is of crucial relevance for the research of ornithologists and ecologists. It was observed that impartial survey information for songbird species is inherently challenging due to observer biases, habitat insurance biases, and logistical constraints. To get to the bottom of all the challenges, ecologists are trying a machine that let them decide the distribution and density of species, which are essential baseline facts for conservation. For this reason, the utilization of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles is introduced for monitoring and capturing the data of a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic species. In this study, an edge-enabled drone network has been engineered that amalgamated with the mobile edge computing framework within the drone network and the machine learning models to predict the bird species.

This work presents robust navigation algorithms for multi-agent fixed-wing aircraft based on an adaptive moving mesh partial differential equations controlled by the free energy heat flow equation. Guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for control of multi-agent unmanned aerial system (UASs) were validated through actual flight tests, and the robustness of these algorithms were also investigated using different aircraft platforms. The verification and validation flight tests were conducted using two different fixed-wing platforms: A DG808 sail-plane with a 4m wingspan T-tail configuration and a Skyhunter aircraft utilizing a 2.4m wingspan and a twin-boom configuration. The developed swarm navigation algorithm uses a virtual leader guidance scheme and has been implemented and optimized using optimal control theory.

{"TI": "Research on Public Air Route Network Planning of Urban Low-Altitude Logistics Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", "DE": "logistics unmanned aerial vehicle; urban air mobility; Voronoi diagram; A* algorithm; public air route network", "AB": "As urban populations continue to grow and road traffic congestion worsens, traditional ground logistics has become less efficient. This has led to longer logistics times and increased costs. Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) logistics has become increasingly popular. However, free-planned routes cannot meet the safety and efficiency requirements of urban airspace mobility. To address this issue, a public air route network for low-altitude logistics UAVs needs to be established in urban areas. This paper proposes a public route network planning method based on the obstacle-based Voronoi diagram and A* algorithm, as follows: Firstly, construct a city airspace grid model in which the characteristics of the airspace are mapped onto the grid map. Introduce an obstacle clustering algorithm based on DBSCAN to generate representative obstacle points as the Voronoi seed nodes. Utilize the Voronoi diagram to establish the initial route network. Then, conduct an improved path planning by employing the A* algorithm for obstacle avoidance in route edges that pass through obstacles. To ensure the safe operation of drones, set constraints on the route safety interval. This process will generate a low-altitude public air route network for urban areas. After considering the flight costs of logistics UAVs at different altitudes, the height for the route network layout is determined. Finally, the route network evaluation indicators are established. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the city road network planning method and the central radial network planning method, the total route length is shortened by 7.1% and 9%, respectively, the airspace coverage is increased by 9.8% and 35%, respectively, the average network degree is reduced by 52.6% and 212%, respectively, and the average flight time is reduced by 19.4s and 3.7s, respectively. In addition, by solving the network model using the Dijkstra algorithm, when the energy cost and risk cost weights are 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, and the safety interval is taken as 15 m, the total path cost value of the planned trajectory is minimized.

This complexity is due to the continuous changes taking place, particularly in ensuring the quality of food products throughout the entire supply chain, from growing, procurement of resources, production, and management of stock, to distribution to the final consumers. For that, food supply chain markets have become more highly developed in the use of modern technologies, and have begun to implement them in their logistical systems to satisfy their customers' needs. The main objectives of this review are to identify the different technological implementations in different phases of the food supply chain processes and point out the key factors for using technologies to improve the characteristics of the perishable food supply chain. A total number of 137 articles were analyzed in this research to achieve these review objectives. Some of the various technologies found in different phases of the food supply chain were radio frequency identification (RFID), the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, three-dimensional printing (3DP), autonomous vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These technologies were found in different phases of the food supply chain and improved the efficiency of supplying perishable foods. The review identified different characteristics of the perishable food supply chain.

Drone-based distribution is an emerging solution investigated in this study to transport packages from a land base to the islands. Considering the drone costs, drone landing platforms in islands, and incorporation into the island ground distribution system, this study categorizes the direct, point-to-point, and cyclic bi-stage distribution modes: in the direct mode, the packages are distributed from the drone base station to the customers directly by drones; in the point-to-point mode, the packages are transported to the drone landing platform and then distributed to the customers independently; in the cyclic mode, the packages are distributed from a drone landing platform by a closed route. The modes are formulated, and evaluation metrics and solution methods are developed. In the experiments based on an island case, the models and solution methods are demonstrated, compared, and analyzed. The cyclic bi-stage distribution mode can improve drone flying distance by 50%, and an iterative heuristic algorithm can further improve drone flying distance by 27.8%, and the ground costs by 3.16%, average for the settings of twenty to sixty customers and two to four drone landing platforms.

First, a mathematical model is used to construct a three-dimensional terrain environment, and a multi-constraint path cost model is established, framing path planning as a multidimensional function optimization problem. Second, recognizing the sensitivity of population diversity to Logistic Chaotic Mapping in a traditional Human Evolution Optimization Algorithm (HEOA), an opposition-based learning strategy is employed to uniformly initialize the population distribution, thereby enhancing the algorithm's global optimization capability. Additionally, a guidance factor strategy is introduced into the leader role during the development stage, providing clear directionality for the search process, which increases the probability of selecting optimal paths and accelerates the convergence speed. Furthermore, in the loser update strategy, an adaptive t-distribution perturbation strategy is utilized for its small mutation amplitude, which enhances the local search capability and robustness of the algorithm. Evaluations using 12 standard test functions demonstrate that these improvement strategies effectively enhance convergence precision and algorithm stability, with the IHEOA, which integrates multiple strategies, performing particularly well. Experimental comparative research on three different terrain environments and five traditional algorithms shows that the IHEOA not only exhibits excellent performance in terms of convergence speed and precision but also generates superior paths while demonstrating exceptional global optimization capability and robustness in complex environments. These results validate the significant advantages of the proposed improved algorithm in effectively addressing UAV path planning challenges.

Methods: A machine learning method is used to extract the main topics from more than 2000 journal publications indexed in WoS and Scopus. Results: The research findings highlight key issues related to technology, cybersecurity, data governance, regulations, and legal frameworks, providing a different perspective compared to human manual reviews of papers. Conclusions: Our search results confirm several recommendations. First, from a technological perspective, it is advised to increase support for the research and development of autonomous underwater vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, establish safety standards, mandate testing of wave model evaluation systems, and promote international standardization. Second, from a cyber-physical systems perspective, efforts should be made to strengthen logistics and supply chains for autonomous ships, establish data governance protocols, enforce strict control over IoT device data, and strengthen cybersecurity measures. Third, from an environmental perspective, measures should be implemented to address the environmental impact of autonomous ships.

Marine turtles are a challenging taxon for the study of reproductive ecology and breeding strategies, because turtles aggregate off-shore and males remain exclusively at sea. For successful management of sea turtle populations, determining operational sex ratios (OSRs) on a continuing basis is critical for determining long-term population viability, particularly in the context of changing hatchling sex ratios due to temperature-dependent sex determination in a warming climate. To understand how survey technique and stage of the breeding season might influence the ability to detect turtles and determine OSRs, we surveyed the presence and identified the sex of adult male and female green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) using a boat and small commercial unoccupied/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), at the start (October) and peak (December) of a nesting season at an important breeding site at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The ratio of males to females within the breeding ground detected by both survey methods changed from being male-biased in October to heavily female-biased in December, indicating that most males cease their reproductive effort and depart before the peak of the nesting season. Surveying with a UAV more than doubled the rate of turtles seen per minute of survey effort compared with surveying solely from the boat and allowed surveys to be conducted at times and/or places unsafe or inaccessible for boats. The sex of a slightly greater proportion of turtles seen could not be identified by observers using a UAV versus a boat, although more turtles were detected using the UAV. The departure of many males during the peak of the nesting season is likely due to an increasing biological cost of residency in the area because males encounter fewer receptive females as the season progresses and the limited foraging opportunity is insufficient to support the number of males present. Overall, we found that UAVs are an effective tool for studying important but difficult to observe aspects of sea turtle biology.

{"TI": "Assessing the status of forest regeneration using digital aerial photogrammetry and unmanned aerial systems", "AB": "Accurate, reliable, and cost-effective methods of evaluating forest regeneration success are needed to improve forest inventories and silvicultural operations. While traditional surveys are relatively inexpensive and meet current data requirements, their annual coverage of over 1 million hectares in British Columbia alone are operationally and logistically intensive. To improve the efficiency and utility of forest regeneration inventories, the incorporation of multi-temporal monitoring linked to years since planting (YSP) could help improve understanding of rates and characteristics of vegetative succession while providing a means to evaluate the economic and operational success of management actions on public land. In this study, we evaluate the potential of utilizing Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-acquired very high spatial resolution imagery to provide spatial, spectral, and structural information on forest regeneration in previously clear-cut stands near Nakusp and Quesnel, British Columbia, Canada. Three stands approximately 5, 10, and 15 YSP were chosen at both sites. Using wall-to-wall UAS-acquired red-green-blue (RGB) imagery, dense Digital Aerial Photogrammetric (DAP) point clouds were produced providing forest structure information. Spectral data in the form of Visible Vegetation Indices (VVI) including the Normalized Green Red Difference Index(NGRDI), visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI(g)), and Green Leaf Indices (GLI(x)) were computed. Spectral and structural information from the VVI and DAP were combined to perform Object-Based Image Analyses (OBIA) facilitating supervised classifications of forest cover into conifer, deciduous, and ground classes. Independent classifications were performed on each stand, yielding high overall accuracies (86-95% for Nakusp; 93-95% for Quesnel). Spectral and structural differences amongst classes and YSP were analysed. Height and area coverage of conifers were found to increase with YSP in both sites (0.7-2.7m for Nakusp; 0.3-2.2m for Quesnel), while VVI metrics were shown to be more successful than standard RGB at differentiating forest cover through time. The results of this study indicate that UAS-acquired imagery has a potential niche for quickly, accurately, and reliably providing highly detailed spatial, spectral, and structural information on forest regeneration. Methodology and data products from this study show promise for benefiting silvicultural monitoring and operations while improving multi-temporal forest inventory knowledge. C1 [Goodbody, Tristan R.

Yield estimation from these technologies is essential for optimizing resource allocation, improving harvest logistics, and supporting decision-making for sustainable vineyard management. This study aimed to evaluate grape cluster numbers estimated by using YOLOv7x in combination with images obtained by UAVs from a vineyard. Additionally, the capability of several vegetation indices calculated from Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope satellites to estimate grape clusters was evaluated. The results showed that the application of the YOLOv7x model to RGB images acquired from UAVs was able to accurately predict grape cluster numbers (R2 value and RMSE value of 0.64 and 0.78 clusters vine-1). On the contrary, vegetation indexes derived from Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope satellites were found not able to predict grape cluster numbers (R2 lower than 0.23), probably due to the fact that these indexes are more related to vegetation vigor, which is not always related to yield parameters (e.g., cluster number). This study suggests that the combination of high-resolution UAV images, multispectral satellite images, and advanced detection models like YOLOv7x can significantly improve the accuracy of vineyard management, resulting in more efficient and sustainable agriculture.

With the popularization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) techniques and the reform of low altitude airspace, terminal logistics distribution is expected to be carried out by drones. Therefore, it is of great significance to construct a reasonable air route network for logistics UAV to ensure the safety and efficiency of operations. In this paper, a single route planning model and an air route network planning model for UAV were constructed by fully considering the complex urban low altitude environment, the flight performance of UAV and the characteristics of logistics tasks to regulate the flights of drones. Then, taking Jiangjun Road Campus of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics as an example, the improved cellular automata (CA) was adopted to search for the optimal route between different waypoints, and the optimal spanning tree algorithm was used to construct the route network. The experimental results demonstrated that the improved CA could greatly reduce search time and obtain the optimal route while enhancing safety. With the satisfaction of the voyage, the needs of logistics and distribution constraints, a network that had smaller intersection points and redundancy was generated. The models and core ideas proposed in this paper can not only regulate operation of drones but also provide a solid foundation for the distribution of logistics UAV in the future.

The focus on nodal assets rather than linear assets like roads, railways, bridges, and waterways fills a gap in addressing the dynamic challenges specific to transportation hubs. This study reviews scholarly literature on applying UAV-based remote sensing (URS) techniques to assess the condition of various transportation hubs, which are critical junctures in global logistics networks. Utilizing a systematic literature review framework, this study reviewed 486 publications from 2015 to 2023 to extract insights from the evolving discourse on URS applications. The findings suggest that these emerging methods resulted in substantial enhancements in time saving, cost efficiency, safety, and reliability. Specifically, this study presents evidence on how URS approaches can overcome the constraints of conventional inspection methods by enabling rapid, high-precision mapping and surveillance in complex and constrained environments. The findings highlight the role of UAVs in enhancing operational workflows and decision making in transportation planning and maintenance.

A considerable number of works have studied different aspects of drone package delivery service by a supplier, one of which is delivery planning. However, existing works addressing the planning issues consider a simple case of perfect delivery without service interruption, e.g., due to accident, which is common and realistic. Therefore, this paper introduces the joint ground and aerial delivery service optimization and planning (GADOP) framework. The framework explicitly incorporates uncertainty of drone package delivery, i.e., takeoff and breakdown conditions. The GADOP framework aims to minimize the total delivery cost, given practical constraints, e.g., travelling distance limit. Specifically, we formulate the GADOP framework as a three-stage stochastic integer programming model. To deal with the high complexity issue of the problem, a decomposition method is adopted. Then, the performance of the GADOP framework is evaluated by using two data sets including the Solomon benchmark suite and the real data from one of the Singapore logistics companies. The performance evaluation clearly shows that the GADOP framework can achieve significantly lower total payment than that of the baseline methods, which do not take uncertainty into account.

First, we present a simple, affordable SfM workflow, based on an unmanned helium balloon or motorized glider, an inexpensive camera, and semiautomated software. Second, we illustrate the system at two sites on southern California faults covered by existing airborne or terrestrial LiDAR, enabling a comparative assessment of SfM topography resolution and precision. At the first site, an similar to 0.1 km(2) alluvial fan on the San Andreas fault, a colored point cloud of density mostly >700 points/m(2) and a 3 cm digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto were produced from 233 photos collected similar to 50 m above ground level. When a few global positioning system ground control points are incorporated, closest point vertical distances to the much sparser (similar to 4 points/m(2)) airborne LiDAR point cloud are mostly <3 cm. The second site spans an similar to 1 km section of the 1992 Landers earthquake scarp. A colored point cloud of density mostly >530 points/m(2) and a 2 cm DEM and orthophoto were produced from 450 photos taken from similar to 60 m above ground level. Closest point vertical distances to existing terrestrial LiDAR data of comparable density are mostly <6 cm. Each SfM survey took similar to 2 h to complete and several hours to generate the scene topography and texture.

Remote medical support, commodities transportation within due time, live-action movies, cinematography, distant communication support, and many other provisions are provided by drones right now. However, the selection of drones for a particular job is quite sensitive and not all drones are feasible for any job. In this case, we need to scientifically assess and confirm drone performance in logistics and transportation. In this study, we present a Bayesian Network (BN) approach to predict the overall performance of drone technology through four prime criteria (factors), namely: physical specification, technical responses, functional performance, and economic cost. To that end, we have developed a Bayesian network approach to portray the causal relationships between the various factors that affect drone selection based on their performance, and subsequently, predicted the posterior probability of drone performance conditioned upon the aforementioned salient criteria. To evaluate the model further, a number of analyses, such as Bayesian inference algorithm (belief propagation) and sensitivity analyses have been carried out. The results show that when the physical specification criteria are met, the economic factor is most imperious to the overall performance of the drone, followed by functional performance and technical responsiveness. This research would invoke richer dialogue for the researchers and practitioners to select and use suitable drones and develop subsequent policies for different transportation scenarios under uncertainty.

However, the existing studies often overlook the dynamic nature of customer demands and wind conditions, limiting the practical applicability of their proposed strategies. To tackle this challenge, we firstly construct a time-slicing-based UAV path planning model that incorporates dynamic customer demands and wind impacts. Based on this model, a two-stage logistics UAV path planning framework is developed according to the analysis of the customer pool updates and dynamic attitudes. Secondly, a dynamic demand and wind-aware logistics UAV path planning problem is formulated to minimize the weighted average of the energy consumption and the customer satisfaction penalty cost, which comprehensively takes the energy consumption constraints, load weight constraints, and hybrid time window constraints into consideration. To solve this problem, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based multiple logistics UAV path planning algorithm is developed, which has good performance with fast convergence and better solutions. Finally, extensive simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can not only adhere to the UAV's maximum load and battery power constraints but also significantly enhance the loading efficiency and battery utilization rate. Particularly, compared to the genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), and traditional PSO strategies, our proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory solutions within a reasonable time frame and reduces the distribution costs by up to 9.82%.

However, hydrogen storage faces challenges, including low volumetric density, fire and explosion risks and transport challenges. We assessed over fifteen hydrogen carriers based on their maritime performance characteristics to determine their suitability for shipboard use. Evaluation criteria included energy density, locally zero-emission, circularity of process, safety, dehydrogenation process, logistic availability and handling. Thus, excluding ammonia and methanol because of these constraints, we found that borohydrides, liquid organic hydrogen carriers and ammoniaborane are the most promising hydrogen carriers to use on ships with PEM fuel cells. Borohydrides, specifically sodium borohydride, have high energy densities but face regeneration issues. The liquid organic hydrogen carrier dibenzyltoluene has a lower energy density but exhibits easy hydrogenation and good handling. Given varying operational demands, we developed a framework to assess the suitability of hydrogen carriers for use in different ship categories. Evaluating the three types of hydrogen carriers, using our framework and considering current practices, shows that these are viable options for almost all ship types. Thus, we have identified three types of hydrogen carriers, which should be the focus of future research. C1 [Van Rheenen, E.

Effective identity authentication and key agreement schemes are vital for UAV networks to combat threats. Current schemes often employ algorithms like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address this issue, we propose LIGKYX, a novel scheme combining the quantum-resistant Kyber algorithm with the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for enhanced security and efficiency. This scheme enables the mutual authentication between UAVs and ground stations and supports secure session key establishment protocols. Additionally, it facilitates robust authentication and key agreement among UAVs through control stations, addressing the critical challenge of quantum-resistant security in UAV networks. The proposed LIGKYX scheme operates based on the Kyber algorithm and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol, employing the HMAC and pre-computation techniques. Furthermore, a formal verification tool validated the security of LIGKYX under the Dolev-Yao threat model. Comparative analyses on security properties, communication overhead, and computational overhead indicate that LIGKYX not only matches or exceeds existing schemes but also uniquely counters quantum attacks effectively, ensuring the security of UAV communication networks with a lower time overhead for authentication and communication.

With the emergence of edge computing, IoT devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can process data instantly at the point of generation, which significantly decreases the requirement for on-board processing power and minimises the data transfer time to enable real-time applications. Meanwhile, with federated learning (FL), UAVs can enhance their intelligent decision-making capabilities by learning from other UAVs without directly accessing their data. This facilitates rapid model iteration and improvement while safeguarding data privacy. However, in many UAV applications such as UAV logistics, different UAVs may perform different tasks and cover different areas, which can result in heterogeneous data and add to the problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data for model training. To address such a problem, we introduce a novel cloud-edge-end collaborative FL framework, which organises and combines local clients through clustering and aggregation. By employing the cosine similarity, we identified and integrated the most appropriate local model into the global model, which can effectively address the issue of Non-IID data in UAV logistics.

How to rationally plan multiple UAVs to quickly complete the emergency logistics tasks in many disaster-stricken areas has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, an optimization model is established with the goal of minimizing the task completion time and the penalty cost of advance/delay, and a discrete multi-objective teaching-learning-based optimization (DMOTLBO) algorithm is proposed. The Pareto frontier approximation problem is transformed into a set of single objective sub-problems by the decomposition mechanism of the algorithm, and each sub-problem is solved by the improved discrete TLBO algorithm. According to the characteristics of the problem, TLBO algorithm is improved by discretization, and an individual update method is constructed based on probability fusion of various mutation evolution operators. At the same time, variable neighborhood descent search is introduced to enhance the local search ability. Based on the multi-level comparative experiment, the improvement measures and effectiveness of DMOTLBO are verified. Finally, combined with specific case analysis, the practicability and efficiency of the DMOTLBO algorithm in solving the multi-objective emergency logistics task planning problem of multiple UAVs are further verified.

We employed the Navier-Stokes solver to numerically simulate steady, incompressible flow conditions. By examining the effects of key design parameters on aerodynamic characteristics and bypass flow fields in a two-dimensional state, we were able to suggest a more optimized foldable wing design. Building on the two-dimensional analysis, we performed aerodynamic assessments of the three-dimensional aircraft geometry. Our results indicated that appropriate wing and gap parameters can significantly enhance lift characteristics, maintaining high lift even during large-angle flights. Specifically, when compared to a mono-wing, the lift coefficient of the bi-wing increased by 27.1% at a 14 degrees angle of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of our wing-and-gap design. Optimal aerodynamic performance was achieved when the gap distance equalled the chord length in both flow and vertical directions. Further, the right combination of airfoil configuration, wing axes angle, and wingspan can improve flow field aerodynamic characteristics, while also enhancing the wing's stall capacity. The lift coefficient reached its maximum value at an angle of attack of 15 degrees, which has the potential to reduce takeoff and landing distances, thereby enhancing the UAV's overall safety.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a promising alternative tool in last-mile delivery, which is however limited by insufficient flight range and load capacity. This paper presents an innovative energy-limited logistics UAV schedule approach using crowdsourced buses. Specifically, when one UAV delivers a parcel, it first lands on a crowdsourced social bus to parcel destination, gets recharged by the wireless recharger deployed on the bus, and then flies from the bus to the parcel destination. This novel approach not only increases the delivery range and load capacity of battery-limited UAVs, but is also much more cost-effective and environment-friendly than traditional methods. New challenges therefore emerge as the buses with spatiotemporal mobility become the bottleneck during delivery. By landing on buses, an Energy-Neutral Flight Principle and a delivery scheduling algorithm are proposed for the UAVs. Using the Energy-Neutral Flight Principle, each UAV can plan a flying path without depleting energy given buses with uncertain velocities. Besides, the delivery scheduling algorithm optimizes the delivery time and number of delivered parcels given warehouse location, logistics UAVs, parcel locations and buses. Comprehensive evaluations using a large-scale bus dataset demonstrate the superiority of the innovative logistics UAV schedule approach.

This is due to its advantages including fast response times, energy efficiency and cost effectiveness over conventional cloud computing platforms. However, running complex computational scientific workflow tasks is still a very challenging issue at the edge, due to its typical three-layered computing environment consisting of an end device layer, an edge server layer, and a cloud server layer. A large number of recent studies have proposed different solutions for optimizing such computing resource management problems in an edge computing environment. However, since evaluation of most such studies is conducted through simulation, the effectiveness cannot be guaranteed in a real world environment. Therefore, to advance research on efficient execution and deployment problems for real world workflow applications using edge computing, an open-source edge workflow management system with comprehensive empirical evaluation capabilities is urgently required. This paper presents the first edge workflow system (named EdgeWorkflow) that is able to deploy user-created workflow applications to a real-world edge computing environment with \"one-click'' after optimizing the configuration with the simulation tool. With the aid of EdgeWorkflow, the user can automate the generation of specific edge computing environments, easily model and generate executable workflow applications with a visual modelling tool, effectively select various resource management methods included in the systems or apply their own resource management and task scheduling algorithms, efficiently monitor the statuses of computational tasks and obtain comprehensive reports on the execution results (such as those regarding time, cost and energy). We use an edge computing-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) last-mile delivery system as a real-world case study, and a number of representative scientific workflows are employed for our experiments. Our experimental results show that EdgeWorkflow can effectively evaluate the performance of different resource management and workflow task scheduling algorithms and efficiently deploy and execute user-defined scientific workflow applications to user-specified edge computing environments.

Increasing demands and labor shortages make efficient instant delivery more challenging. Recently, the industry has recruited Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and part-time couriers to address this critical issue. However, the inherent delivery ability of crowdsourced couriers and the limited battery capacity of UAVs make them hard to solely meet the rapidly increasing instant delivery demands. Therefore, this paper proposes the first air-ground cooperative UAV and Courier Delivery paradigm, called UCD, to develop an optimal courier recruitment plan and assignment of instant delivery tasks for UAVs and couriers. In the UCD paradigm, courier and UAV delivery models are introduced, and a recruitment plan that considers both delivery demand and courier availability is designed. With this foundation, a data-driven algorithm is proposed to optimize delivery task assignments, maximizing the flexibility of UAVs and the capacity of couriers. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on multiple long-term real-world datasets to demonstrate the superior performance of UCD.

Manned aircraft flying transects often remain the best alternative for counting large ungulates. Drones have cheaper and safer logistics, however their range is generally too short for large-scale application of the traditional method. Our paper investigates an innovative rosette flight plan for wildlife census, and evaluates relevance of this sampling protocol by comparing its statistical performance with transects, based on numerical simulations. (2) The UAS flight plan consisted in two rosettes of 6 triangular '' petals '' spread across the survey area, for a theoretical sampling rate of 2.95%, as opposed to a 20.04% classic sampling protocol with systematic transects. We tested the logistics of our survey design in Garamba National Park. We then modeled theoretical population distributions for both antelopes and buffaloes. We calculated animal densities in the simulated footprints of the theoretical rosette and transect flight plans. We also tested aggregating results for 2, 3 and 4 repetitions of the same rosette flight plan to increase the sampling rate. (3) Simulation results showed that the coefficient of variation associated with density estimates decreases with the number of repetitions of the rosette flight plan, and aggregating four repetitions is enough to give antelope densities with acceptable accuracy and precision while staying at a lower sampling rate. Buffalo densities displayed much higher variability and it shows the significant impact of gregariousness on density estimate accuracy and precision. (4) The method was found to be inappropriate for highly aggregative species but efficient for species that disperse widely and more randomly in their environment. Logistics required to perform a full survey in the field remain time- and resources-intensive. Therefore, we recommend it for remote parks facing difficulties to organize manned aerial counts. Lower costs and developments such as solar UASs offer interesting future perspectives.

The data included aerial survey maps of the Forestry Bureau for years 1982, 2002, and 2006, which served as predictors, while the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveyed data of 2019 served as the respondent. The MLP was configured using five different activation functions with the aim of evaluating their significance. These functions were Identity, Tahn, Logistic, Exponential, and Sine Functions. The results have shown that the performance of an MLP model may be affected by the choice of an activation function. Logistic and the Tahn activation functions outperformed the other models, with Logistic performing best in three beaches and Tahn having the rest. These findings suggest that the application of machine learning to shoreline changes should be accompanied by an extensive evaluation of the different activation functions.

These systems are employed for the fire protection of selected buildings (stationary) or to monitor vast areas, e.g., forests, airports, logistics hubs, etc. (non-stationary). An FAS is operated under various environmental conditions, indoor and outdoor, favourable or unfavourable to the operation process. Therefore, an FAS has to exhibit a reliable structure in terms of power supply and operation. To this end, the paper discusses a representative FAS monitoring a facility and presents basic tactical and technical assumptions for a non-stationary system. The authors reviewed fire detection methods in terms of fire characteristic values (FCVs) impacting detector sensors. Another part of the article focuses on false alarm causes. Assumptions behind the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with visible-range cameras (e.g., Aviotec) and thermal imaging were presented for non-stationary FASs. The FAS operation process model was defined and a computer simulation related to its operation was conducted. Analysing the FAS operation process in the form of models and graphs, and the conducted computer simulation enabled conclusions to be drawn. They may be applied for the design, ongoing maintenance and operation of an FAS. As part of the paper, the authors conducted a reliability analysis of a selected FAS based on the original performance tests of an actual system in operation. They formulated basic technical and tactical requirements applicable to stationary and mobile FASs detecting the so-called vast fires.

In this study, the multi-UAV collaborative task planning and the distribution path planning were discussed, and such constraint conditions as UAV load capacity, battery capacity and flight time were comprehensively considered, aiming to reduce the number of UAVs and their power consumption. To ensure the safe and efficient completion of multi-UAV logistics distribution tasks, 3D agricultural ultralow space was subjected to environment modeling, and a bilevel planning model for collaborative planning of UAV distribution route and flight path was constructed. Then, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the improved learning factor and inertia coefficient was designed on the basis of PSO framework, and the global optimal solution in the current iteration was improved using variable neighborhood descent search. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was verified by analyzing a practical case. With the central city area of XX City as the study area, 1 logistics & freight transportation center was taken as the central warehouse (coordinates: 50, 50, unit: km) and 50 intelligent express cabinets as the express cabinets of UAVs. The obtained results were comparatively analyzed with those acquired through the basic PSO algorithm. The results manifest that the proposed algorithm performs better than the compared algorithms. The improved PSO algorithm is superior to the basic PSO algorithm in aspects of total UAV flight distance, number of UAVs used and algorithm convergence time, indicating that the model and algorithm established in this study are feasible and effective.

{"TI": "UAV Group Distribution Route Optimization Under Time-Varying Weather Network", "AB": "The rapid advancement in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has marked a transformative shift in various industries, with logistics distribution service being one of the prime sectors reaping the benefits. UAVs offer substantial benefits in speed, cost, and reach, promising to revolutionize logistics, especially in remote areas. On the one hand, they are poised to meet demands for quick and versatile delivery options. On the other hand, their deployment comes with challenges. Weather variabilities such as rainfall, wind speed, and the need for safe take-off intervals can compromise UAV safety and operation. Conventional route optimization often overlooks these dynamic factors, resulting in inefficient or unworkable delivery routes. The repeated time-consuming calculations are caused by repeated trials when making UAV group distribution plans. Recognizing these gaps, this study proposes a data representation to effectively transform the flight flyable area of UAVs into a time-varying network that maintains spatiotemporal connectivity and establishes a mathematical model that represents the complexities of UAV group distribution. Then, a multistage dynamic optimization algorithm specifically tailored for large-scale time-varying network distribution route search is designed to obtain the stable and optimal solution. Subsequent experimental validations on actual case datasets have confirmed the correctness, effectiveness, and adaptability of the algorithm. Benchmarking against traditional CPLEX methods demonstrated that the algorithm not only rivals the best solutions but does so with a 38.8 times increase in computational speed. When pitted against the shortest path Dijkstra and A & lowast; algorithms, the method consistently outperformed, delivering solutions up to 3.5 times faster in large-scale applications. Moreover, the parameter sensitivity analysis is performed on the algorithm by adjusting the safe flight thresholds of rainfall and wind speed parameters and revealed that the performance of the algorithm has a strong positive correlation with the size of the time-varying network.

Existing literature ontruck-drone tandems predominantly restricts the UAV launch and recovery operations (LARO)to customer locations. Such a constrained setting may not be able to fully exploit the capabilityof drones. Moreover, this assumption may not accurately reflect the actual delivery operations.In this research, we address these gaps and introduce a new variant of truck-drone tandemthat allows the truck to stop at non-customer locations (referred to as flexible sites) for droneLARO. The proposed variant also accounts for three key decisions - (i) assignment of eachcustomer location to a vehicle, (ii) routing of truck and UAVs, and (iii) scheduling drone LAROand truck operator activities at each stop, which are always not simultaneously considered inthe literature. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to jointly optimize thethree decisions with the objective of minimizing the delivery completion time (or makespan).To handle large problem instances, we develop an optimization-enabled two-phase searchalgorithm by hybridizing simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search. Numericalanalysis demonstrates substantial improvement in delivery efficiency of using flexible sites forLARO as opposed to the existing approach of restricting truck stop locations. Finally, severalinsights on drone utilization and flexible site selection are provided based on our findings C1 [Salama, Mohamed R.; Srinivas, Sharan] Univ Missouri, Coll Engn, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.

In this scenario, parcels need to be delivered to each customer point. The major feature of the problem is the combination of a fleet of road vehicles (vans) with a drone. Each van visits a subset of demand nodes to be determined according to the route of the van. The drone serves the customers not served by vans. At the same time, considering the safety, policy and terrain as well as the need to replace the battery, the drone needs to be transported by truck to the identified station along with the parcel. From each such station, the drone serves a subset of customers according to a direct assignment pattern, i.e., every time the drone is launched, it serves one demand node and returns to the station to collect another parcel. Similarly, the truck is used to transport the drone and cargo between stations. This is somewhat different from the research of other scholars. In terms of the joint distribution of the drone and road vehicle, most scholars will choose the combination of two transportation tools, while we use three. The drone and vans are responsible for distribution services, and the trucks are responsible for transporting the goods and drone to the station. The goal is to optimize the total delivery cost which includes the transportation costs for the vans and the delivery cost for the drone. A fixed cost is also considered for each drone parking site corresponding to the cost of positioning the drone and using the drone station. A discrete optimization model is presented for the problem in addition to a two-phase heuristic algorithm. The results of a series of computational tests performed to assess the applicability of the model and the efficiency of the heuristic are reported. The results obtained show that nearly 10% of the cost can be saved by combining the traditional delivery mode with the use of a drone and drone stations.

Amazon has an issued patent that describes how drones scan and collect data on their fly-overs while dropping off packages. In this context, we propose a path optimization algorithm for a drone multi-hop communications network that can carry and forward data in addition to its primary function of parcel deliveries. We argue that traditional Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) based protocols may not be efficient for this purpose. Therefore, this paper proposes a new DTN-based algorithm that optimizes drone flight paths in conjunction with optimized routing to deliver both parcels and data in a power efficient way and within the shortest possible time. We propose a heuristic algorithm called Weighted Flight Path Planning (WFPP) that priorities the data packets in an exchange pool in order to create an optimized path for the drones. Our approach is to determine a weight for each packet based on the packet & x2019;s remaining time to live, priority, size, and location of the packet & x2019;s destination. When two drones meet each other, they exchange the high weighted packets. Simulation studies show that WFPP delivers up to 25 & x0025; more packets compared with EBR, EPIDEMIC, and a similar path planning method. Also, WFPP reduces the data delivery delays by up to 66 & x0025; while the overhead ratio is low.

Drone delivery offers benefits over conventional ground-based vehicle delivery in terms of faster speed, lower cost, more environment-friendly, and less manpower needed. However, most of existing studies on drone delivery planning and scheduling focus on a single shipper and ignore uncertainty factors. As such, in this paper, we consider a scenario that multiple shippers can cooperate to minimize their drone delivery cost. We propose the Bayesian Shipper Cooperation in Stochastic Drone Delivery (BCoSDD) framework. The framework is composed of three functions, i.e., package assignment, shipper cooperation formation and cost management. The uncertainties of drone breakdown and misbehavior of cooperative shippers are taken into account by using multistage stochastic programming optimization and dynamic Bayesian coalition formation game. We conduct extensive performance evaluation of the BCoSDD framework by using customer locations from Solomon benchmark suite and a real Singapore logistics industry. As a result, the framework can help the shippers plan and schedule their drone delivery effectively.

So far, only large passenger aircraft, a few general aviation aircraft, and specialized rotorcraft are equipped with ice protection systems because of their additional energy consumption and weight. The emerging markets of small electric aircraft like Urban Air Mobility and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for transportation, logistics, search and rescue, and other specialized operations will require efficient, lightweight and all-electric ice protection systems in order to allow operations in ice and snow conditions. In this work, an electrothermal ice protection system with an average heat power density of 1 W cm-2 was designed and developed for use on small multirotor drones. Commercially available propeller blades with diameters of 33 cm were retrofitted with lightweight multilayer heating foils independently powered by super-capacitors. The heated propellers were tested in close-to-real icing conditions in a small-scale icing wind tunnel. Thrust, rotational speed, and power consumption of a non-heated reference propeller and a heated propeller were compared. In glaze ice conditions at air temperatures > -5 degrees C the thrust of the non-heated propeller fluctuated between 60 and 90% with frequent cycles of ice accretion and shedding for the entire duration of the test. The heated propeller maintained a thrust of >95% in the same icing conditions. In rime ice conditions at air temperatures < -8 <degrees>C the heating was not sufficient and the thrust of the non-heated and heated propellers similarly decreased over time. Heat flux calculations along the span of the propeller were made for different icing conditions and compared to the heat power density distribution of the tested ice protection system.

UAL is gaining popularity as a quick and safe mode that has the potential to address several logistics challenges. This study has reviewed scientific papers identified using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to understand the features of existing UFT distribution networks, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and UAM. The cross analysis considered UFT features such as the parcel's weight, delivery type (time sensitivity, customer-to-customer, business-to-consumer, or business-to-business), and UFT distribution network types and compared them against the features of UAS such as maximum take-off weight, range, and infrastructure requirements (drone ports). The analysis identified three types of UAL operational concepts: door-to-door direct (D2DD), hybrid, and multimodal. Lightweight deliveries can be operated using D2DD and hybrid through point-to-point (P-P) and extended P-P network concepts. The hybrid concept uses an intermediate drop-off location to deliver goods. Hub-and-spoke (H-S), extended H-S, and trunk line with collecting/distribution network designs can be used for heavyweight cargo operations. D2DD versus hybrid/multimodal concepts were compared based on six thematic clusters (societal implications, safety and security, ethics, environmental issues, public acceptance, and urban planning and infrastructure). This study identified that technological development and innovation could reduce social implications and ethical challenges. Furthermore, public willingness and economic feasibility will determine the success of the operational concepts. The identified UAL operational concepts, network designs, and challenges will help to conduct further research in this subject area.

In this paper, we propose an innovative problem where a battery electric vehicle (BEV) paired with drone is utilized to deliver first-aid items in a rural area. This problem is termed battery electric vehicle traveling salesman problem with drone (BEVTSPD). In BEVTSPD, the BEV and the drone perform delivery tasks coordinately while the BEV can serve as a drone hub. The BEV can also refresh its battery energy to full capacity in battery-swap stations available in the network. An arc-based mixed-integer programming model defined in a multigraph is presented for BEVTSPD. An exact branch-and-price (BP) algorithm and a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) heuristic are developed to solve instances with up to 25 customers in one minute. Numerical experiments show that the heuristic is much more efficient than solving the arc-based model using the ILOG CPLEX solver and BP algorithm. A real-world case study and the sensitivity analysis of different parameters are also conducted and presented. The results indicate that drone speed has a more significant effect on delivery time than the BEV's driving range. C1 [Zhu, Tengkuo; Boyles, Stephen D.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

The drone delivery system aims to reduce the labor cost in the current laborintensive courier industry, as well as avoid the disturbance caused by geographic and demographic features. For the drone delivery service providers to survive and prosper, a pool of shared drones is integrated into the ecological chain, where the courier service providers focus on the delivery operations. For such a drone sharing system, revenue management becomes vital in terms of pricing, drone hiring cost, and service-related cost. To better depict the system dynamics, in the present paper, a time-varying and price-sensitive queueing model is formulated, where the customer behaviors are taken into account, such as balking and abandonment. To guarantee a preset service level, the probability of abandonment and expected delay are considered as the control targets, and the pricing for courier service and the maintained fleet size are considered simultaneously. For the low and moderate quality of service(QoS) target, a fluid control model is constructed with a closed-form solution. For the high QoS target, a modified approximation algorithm is designed to numerically tackle the problem. Based on the simulation, it is observed that the proposed approximation methods not only provide a high-quality joint strategy but also help stabilize the system performance. In addition, only mild price change is needed to reach the optimal condition, and a time lag exists between the optimal fleet sizing and the demand variation, which may shed light on the demand-driven fleet sizing under more general settings.

Socio-economic activities in the coastal and marine Arctic are simultaneously changing. This calls for the establishment of a marine Arctic component of the Pan-Eurasian Experiment (MA-PEEX). There is a need for more in situ observations on the marine atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean, but increasing the amount of such observations is a pronounced technological and logistical challenge. The SMEAR (Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations) concept can be applied in coastal and archipelago stations, but in the Arctic Ocean it will probably be more cost-effective to further develop a strongly distributed marine observation network based on autonomous buoys, moorings, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These have to be supported by research vessel and aircraft campaigns, as well as various coastal observations, including community-based ones. Major manned drift-ing stations may occasionally be comparable to terrestrial SMEAR flagship stations. To best utilize the observations, atmosphere-ocean reanalyses need to be further developed. To well integrate MA-PEEX with the existing terrestrialatmospheric PEEX, focus is needed on the river discharge and associated fluxes, coastal processes, and atmospheric transports in and out of the marine Arctic. More observations and research are also needed on the specific socioeconomic challenges and opportunities in the marine and coastal Arctic, and on their interaction with changes in the climate and environmental system. MA-PEEX will promote international collaboration; sustainable marine meteorological, sea ice, and oceanographic observations; advanced data management; and multidisciplinary research on the marine Arctic and its interaction with the Eurasian continent.

We specifically address the distribution of emergency medical supplies, including medications, vaccines, and essential medical aid, as well as the collection of biological blood samples for testing and analysis. Unique challenges, such as supply shortages, time windows, and geographical considerations, are explicitly taken into account. The problem is first formulated as a mixed- integer linear programming model aimed at maximizing the total profit derived from the execution of a set of emergency healthcare pickup and delivery tasks. An enhanced Q-learning-based adaptive large neighborhood search (QALNS) is proposed for large-scale benchmark instances. QALNS exhibits a superior performance on benchmark instances. It also improves the quality of the solutions on average by 5.49% and 6.86% compared to the Gurobi solver and a state-of-the-art adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm, respectively. Sensitivity analyses are performed on critical factors contributing to the performance of the QALNS algorithm, such as the learning rate and the discount indicator.

{"TI": "3D Tree Dimensionality Assessment Using Photogrammetry and Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", "AB": "Detailed, precise, three-dimensional (3D) representations of individual trees are a prerequisite for an accurate assessment of tree competition, growth, and morphological plasticity. Until recently, our ability to measure the dimensionality, spatial arrangement, shape of trees, and shape of tree components with precision has been constrained by technological and logistical limitations and cost. Traditional methods of forest biometrics provide only partial measurements and are labor intensive. Active remote technologies such as LiDAR operated from airborne platforms provide only partial crown reconstructions. The use of terrestrial LiDAR is laborious, has portability limitations and high cost. In this work we capitalized on recent improvements in the capabilities and availability of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), light and inexpensive cameras, and developed an affordable method for obtaining precise and comprehensive 3D models of trees and small groups of trees. The method employs slow-moving UAVs that acquire images along predefined trajectories near and around targeted trees, and computer vision-based approaches that process the images to obtain detailed tree reconstructions. After we confirmed the potential of the methodology via simulation we evaluated several UAV platforms, strategies for image acquisition, and image processing algorithms. We present an original, step-by-step workflow which utilizes open source programs and original software. We anticipate that future development and applications of our method will improve our understanding of forest self-organization emerging from the competition among trees, and will lead to a refined generation of individual-tree-based forest models.

However, it is highly challenging for a UAV to precisely identify the position for parcel delivering if it is only aided by the GPS, especially in some complex environments with weak signals and high interference. To address this issue, we present a knowledge distillation empowered edge intelligence framework, KeepEdge, to achieve visual information-assisted positioning for the last mile UAV delivery services. In our approach, we integrate deep neural networks (DNN) into an edge computing framework to enable edge intelligence which empowers the UAVs to autonomously identify the expected delivery position using visual information. Deploying the DNN model and conducting model inference on UAVs however, requires high computing performance. To manage the trade-off between the limited resources onboard the UAVs and high-performance requirements, here, we employ knowledge distillation to produce a lightweight model with high accuracy based on the full model trained in the Cloud. The lightweight model with significantly lower complexity and less inference latency is used onboard of the UAVs for accurate positioning. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory performance for assisted positioning. A real-world case study is also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed edge intelligence solution for UAV delivery services.

{"TI": "CUDM: A Combined UAV Detection Model Based on Video Abnormal Behavior", "DE": "UAV; malicious UAVs; object detection; video abnormal behavior", "AB": "The widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has brought many benefits, particularly for military and civil applications. For example, UAVs can be used in communication, ecological surveys, agriculture, and logistics to improve efficiency and reduce the required workforce. However, the malicious use of UAVs can significantly endanger public safety and pose many challenges to society. Therefore, detecting malicious UAVs is an important and urgent issue that needs to be addressed. In this study, a combined UAV detection model (CUDM) based on analyzing video abnormal behavior is proposed. CUDM uses abnormal behavior detection models to improve the traditional object detection process. The work of CUDM can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, our model cuts the video into images and uses the abnormal behavior detection model to remove a large number of useless images, improving the efficiency and real-time detection of suspicious targets. In the second stage, CUDM works to identify whether the suspicious target is a UAV or not. Besides, CUDM relies only on ordinary equipment such as surveillance cameras, avoiding the use of expensive equipment such as radars. A self-made UAV dataset was constructed to verify the reliability of CUDM. The results show that CUDM not only maintains the same accuracy as state-of-the-art object detection models but also reduces the workload by 32%. Moreover, it can detect malicious UAVs in real-time.

In this sense, crop yield potential maps are an asset for farmers making decisions about farm management and planning. Although scientific efforts have been made to determine crop yields from in situ information and through remote sensing, most studies are limited to evaluating data from a single date just before harvest. This has a direct negative impact on the quality and predictability of these estimates, especially for logistics. This study proposes a methodology for the early prediction of tomato yield using decision tree ensembles, vegetation spectral indices, and shape factors from images captured by multispectral sensors on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during different phenological stages of crop development. With the predictive model developed and based on the collection of training characteristics for 6 weeks before harvest, the tomato yield was estimated for a 0.4 ha plot, obtaining an error rate of 9.28%.

The main idea of the 3D UAV path planning problem is how to plan to get an optimal flight path while ensuring that the UAV does not collide with obstacles during flight. This paper transforms the 3D UAV path planning problem into a multi-constrained optimization problem by formulating the path length cost function, the safety cost function, the flight altitude cost function and the smoothness cost function. This paper encodes each feasible flight path as a set of vectors consisting of magnitude, elevation and azimuth angles and searches for the optimal flight path in the configuration space by means of a metaheuristic algorithm. Subsequently, this paper proposes an improved tuna swarm optimization algorithm based on a sigmoid nonlinear weighting strategy, multi-subgroup Gaussian mutation operator and elite individual genetic strategy, called SGGTSO. Finally, the SGGTSO algorithm is compared with some other classical and novel metaheuristics in a 3D UAV path planning problem with nine different terrain scenarios and in the CEC2017 test function set. The comparison results show that the flight path planned by the SGGTSO algorithm significantly outperforms other comparison algorithms in nine different terrain scenarios, and the optimization performance of SGGTSO outperforms other comparison algorithms in 24 CEC2017 test functions.

Mapping of the different types of damages caused by the disease is challenging in high density ecosystems in which spectral variability is high due to canopy heterogeneity. Data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be particularly useful for such tasks due to the high resolution, flexibility of acquisition and cost efficiency of this type of data. In this study, A. glutinosa decline was assessed by considering four categories of tree health status in the field: asymptomatic, dead and defoliation above and below a 50% threshold. A combination of multispectral Parrot Sequoia and UAV unmanned aerial vehicles -red green blue (RGB) data were analysed using classical random forest (RF) and a simple and robust three-step logistic modelling approaches to identify the most important forest health indicators while adhering to the principle of parsimony. A total of 34 remote sensing variables were considered, including a set of vegetation indices, texture features from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital surface model (DSM), topographic and digital aerial photogrammetry-derived structural data from the DSM at crown level. Results The four categories identified by the RF yielded an overall accuracy of 67%, while aggregation of the legend to three classes (asymptomatic, defoliated, dead) and to two classes (alive, dead) improved the overall accuracy to 72% and 91% respectively. On the other hand, the confusion matrix, computed from the three logistic models by using the leave-out cross-validation method yielded overall accuracies of 75%, 80% and 94% for four-, three- and two-level classifications, respectively. Discussion The study findings provide forest managers with an alternative robust classification method for the rapid, effective assessment of areas affected and non-affected by the disease, thus enabling them to identify hotspots for conservation and plan control and restoration measures aimed at preserving black alder forests.

{"TI": "Strawberry canopy structural parameters estimation and growth analysis from UAV multispectral imagery using a geospatial tool", "DE": "Fragaria; Drones; UAV; Growth curve", "AB": "In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platforms equipped with various sensors have been widely used for fast, non-destructive, and high-throughput plant phenotyping studies. However, monitoring the growth of bush crops such as strawberries at the individual plant level remains a challenge for precision agriculture. In this study, a total of 26 UAV multispectral imagery acquisitions were conducted to track the growth of strawberry plants in central Florida during the winter growing season from November 2021 to March 2022. The main contributions of this work include: 1) a geospatial tool using R and Python scripts was proposed for automatic delineation of strawberry canopies from UAV orthomosaic and DSM (Digital Surface Model) images using the Marker Controlled Watershed Algorithm (MCWA), followed by extraction of canopy structural parameters from the CHM (Canopy Height Model) images. The overall detection recall rate was 96.95%, and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) rates for instance segmentation was 99.15%; 2) the growth curve of strawberry plants throughout their life cycle was investigated. A logistic function was used to fit the growth curves of strawberry plants based on the biomass estimated from CHM-derived structural parameters and vegetation indexes (VIs). Wide variability in the shape of growth curves was found among a collection of over 400 varieties and breeding selections. This study provides potential opportunities for non-destructive, multi- temporal analysis of strawberry canopy biomass data, which could help breeders better understand differences in growth over time among strawberry cultivars and investigate the effects of vegetative growth rate on seasonally dynamic fruit yield and quality.

Eighty relevant papers published between 2015-2020 are included. This review evaluates the quality of each model through the newly developed AAODD (Autonomous vehicle Agent-based Overview, Design concepts and Details) protocol in four perspectives: model transparency, research questions, network + agent behaviour and model execution. Then, similarities and particularities of the papers are summarised based on whether AVs are used for passenger mobility or for freight logistics. The reviewed mobility papers exhibit the ABMs' applicability and flexibility for studying different AV operational patterns. We summarise the respective modelling specifications in research questions, data collections, model platforms, model executions, and scenario variations. Overall, by combining AVs with different technical possibilities and operational strategies, the simulation results illustrate that AVs would bring vast benefits to urban mobility networks. Unlike AVs' usage in passenger mobility, it is still unclear how AVs will serve future urban logistics demands. Many operational patterns, including unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous robots, autonomous trucks, and autonomous cargo-hatching vehicles coexist in the research community. The number of relevant papers remains low due to the early stage of AV technology deployment. However, ABMs also prove their applicability for analysing the macro and mesoscopic impacts of freight AV transportation on urban network. The reviewed papers suggest that implementing AVs for urban logistics is more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional delivery vehicles. Overall, ABMs are a powerful tool for simulating future urban scenarios with AVs. By calculating the average score of reviewed papers obtained via AAODD annually, we find that studies simulating AV systems in ABMs are getting more complex by combing diverse technological possibilities, supporting the simulation of more realistic future scenarios. The outcomes of reviewed ABM research reveals that AVs are a promising solution for solving current urban transport problems. Lastly, as nearly all current reviewed studies focus on AVs' usages in either mobility or logistics, research on an integrated simulation that combines AVs for both purposes has been scarcely addressed. We discuss its necessities, possibilities, and opportunities in this paper, to steer future research in this direction.

{"TI": "A variable neighborhood search for flying sidekick traveling salesman problem", "DE": "unmanned aerial vehicle; traveling salesman problem; drone delivery; last mile delivery; randomized variable neighborhood descent", "AB": "The efficiency and dynamism of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have presented substantial application opportunities in several industries in the last years. Notably, logistic companies have given close attention to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck, proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery routes of truck and drone. Computational experiments show the potential of the algorithm to improve significantly delivery time. Furthermore, we provide a new set of instances based on the well-known traveling salesman problem library instances.

{"TI": "The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sample the blow microbiome of small cetaceans", "AB": "Recent studies describe the use of UAVs in collecting blow samples from large whales to analyze the microbial and viral community in exhaled air. Unfortunately, attempts to collect blow from small cetaceans have not been successful due to their swimming and diving behavior. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study we investigated the application of a specific sampling tool attached to a UAV to analyze the blow from small cetaceans and their respiratory microbiome. Preliminary trials to set up the sampling tool were conducted on a group of 6 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, housed at Acquario di Genova, with approximately 1 meter distance between the blowing animal and the tool to obtain suitable samples. The same sampling kit, suspended via a 2 meter rope assembled on a waterproof UAV, flying 3 meters above the animals, was used to sample the blows of 5 wild bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia (Greece) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), to investigate whether this experimental assembly also works for large whale sampling. In order to distinguish between blow-associated microbes and seawater microbes, we pooled 5 seawater samples from the same area where blow samples' collection were carried out. The the respiratory microbiota was assessed by using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene via Illumina Amplicon Sequencing. The pooled water samples contained more bacterial taxa than the blow samples of both wild animals and the sequenced dolphin maintained under human care. The composition of the bacterial community differed between the water samples and between the blow samples of wild cetaceans and that under human care, but these differences may have been mediated by different microbial communities between seawater and aquarium water. The sperm whale's respiratory microbiome was more similar to the results obtained from wild bottlenose dolphins. Although the number of samples used in this study was limited and sampling and analyses were impaired by several limitations, the results are rather encouraging, as shown by the evident microbial differences between seawater and blow samples, confirmed also by the meta-analysis carried out comparing our results with those obtained in previous studies. Collecting exhaled air from small cetaceans using drones is a challenging process, both logistically and technically. The success in obtaining samples from small cetacean blow in this study in comparison to previous studies is likely due to the distance the sampling kit is suspended from the drone, which reduced the likelihood that the turbulence of the drone propeller interfered with successfully sampling blow, suggested as a factor leading to poor success in previous studies.

Current pathways to overcoming these issues include the gradual transition toward a number of emerging transportation technologies, such as, autonomous motor vehicles for human transport, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) and \"drone\" technologies for surveillance, and package deliveries. However, as a long-term solution, transportation scientists are also investigating the once-seemingly futuristic notion of flying car technology-a convergent form of ground/air vehicle transportation, and assessing associated regulations. In this paper, an extensive review of current literature is conducted to explore the technological capabilities of flying cars-each requiring appropriate regulations and governance-to become fully sustainable. Specifically, issues pertinent to training, safety, environment, navigation, infrastructure, logistics/sustainability, and cybersecurity and human factors are explored. This paper concludes with a preliminary quantitative analysis exploring the public perceptions associated with flying cars-including anticipated benefits, concerns, and willingness to both hire and acquire the technology once available to consumers. Insights offered by this data will help inform next-generation policies and standards associated with the gradual advancement of flying cars.

However, real-time communication with drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the IoD environment occurs over an insecure open channel, making it susceptible to various security and privacy vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data interception, denial of service attacks, and privacy concerns. Due to their unique characteristics, including long transmission distances, unstable communication environments, resource limitations, and the highly dynamic nature of UAVs, ensuring the security and privacy of IoD systems is of paramount importance for the success of IoD-based applications. Furthermore, drones are resource-constrained devices, and employing expensive security solutions is impractical, as it would significantly reduce the operational capacity of drones. In this paper, we present the design of an ultralightweight, secure, and robust user-authenticated key agreement framework for the IoD environment, named USAF-IoD. The proposed USAF-IoD is developed by incorporating authenticated encryption (ASCON), cryptographic hashing, XOR operations, and the use of physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs are employed to enhance resistance against physical tampering attacks. The security analysis reveals that the proposed USAF-IoD meets the essential security requirements of the IoD environment. The comparative analysis further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed USAF-IoD, notably excelling in terms of security and functionality characteristics when compared to existing benchmark schemes, and showcasing competitive performance in computation, communication, and energy overheads.

One conceivable scenario of using a drone in conjunction with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels is discussed in earlier literature and termed the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem (PDSTSP). This study extends the problem by considering two different types of drone tasks: drop and pickup. After a drone completes a drop, the drone can either fly back to depot to deliver the next parcels or fly directly to another customer for pickup. Integrated scheduling of multiple depots hosting a fleet of trucks and a fleet of drones is further studied to achieve an operational excellence. A vehicle that travels near the boundary of the coverage area might be more effective to serve customers that belong to the neighboring depot. This problem is uniquely modeled as an unrelated parallel machine scheduling with sequence dependent setup, precedence-relationship, and reentrant, which gives us a framework to effectively consider those operational challenges. A constraint programming approach is proposed and tested with problem instances of m-truck, m-drone, m-depot, and hundred-customer distributed across an 8-mile square region.

{"TI": "Optimal allocation of defibrillator drones in mountainous regions", "DE": "Drone; Emergency response; Sudden cardiac arrest; Automated external defibrillator; Location allocation; Integer linear programming", "AB": "Responding to emergencies in Alpine terrain is quite challenging as air ambulances and mountain rescue services are often confronted with logistics challenges and adverse weather conditions that extend the response times required to provide life-saving support. Among other medical emergencies, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the most time-sensitive event that requires the quick provision of medical treatment including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and electric shocks by automated external defibrillators (AED). An emerging technology called unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) is regarded to support mountain rescuers in overcoming the time criticality of these emergencies by reducing the time span between SCA and early defibrillation. A drone that is equipped with a portable AED can fly from a base station to the patient's site where a bystander receives it and starts treatment. This paper considers such a response system and proposes an integer linear program to determine the optimal allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region. In detail, the developed model follows the objectives to minimize the number of used drones and to minimize the average travel times of defibrillator drones responding to SCA patients. In an example of application, under consideration of historical helicopter response times, the authors test the developed model and demonstrate the capability of drones to speed up the delivery of AEDs to SCA patients. Results indicate that time spans between SCA and early defibrillation can be reduced by the optimal allocation of drone base stations in a given geographical region, thus increasing the survival rate of SCA patients.

It is challenging to carry out research designed to plan the path of eVTOL UAVs which can have a safe and sustainable operation mode in urban areas. Therefore, this work proposes a method for planning an obstacle-free path for eVTOL UAVs in urban areas with the goal of minimizing energy consumption. It aims to improve the safety and sustainability of eVTOL UAV operations. Based on variations of air density with height, a more accurate formula for calculating battery energy consumption of eVTOL UAV is derived. It is used in the vertical takeoff and landing phase and horizontal flight phase, respectively. Considering the influence of buildings on eVTOL UAV operation, a path planning method applicable to complex urban environments is proposed. The safe nodes of eVTOL UAV flight are obtained by using Voronoi diagrams based on building locations. Then, the complete shortest and obstacle-free path is obtained by using a Dubins geometric path and Floyd algorithm. After obtaining the obstacle-free paths for all flight height zones, the battery energy consumption of the eVTOL UAV in each flight height zone is calculated. Then, the flight height with the minimum energy consumption is obtained. The simulation results show that the path length obtained by the proposed path planning method is shorter than that obtained by particle swarm optimization; the total battery energy consumption changes in the same pattern in the low-altitude areas and high-altitude areas; the difference between the maximum and minimum energy consumption in the small area enables the eVTOL UAV to cover about 350 m more, and about 420 m more in the large area. Therefore, in future high-frequency UAV mission flights, choosing the altitude with the lowest energy consumption can reduce UAV operator costs. It can also significantly increase UAV transport range and make UAVs operate more sustainably.

Metal Halide Perovskites Solar Cells (MH-PSCs) provide a transformative, low-cost solution for high-efficiency PV with diverse compositions, exceptional optoelectronic properties, and low-temperature, solution-based processability. Conventionally the MH-PSCs are fabricated in \"p-i-n\" or \"n-i-p\" configuration on glass-Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) substrates. While glass-based Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable efficiencies, their limited scalability, high areal-weight, and mechanical rigidity greatly limit their usage in wearables electronics, BIPVs, and e-mobility applications. Addressing these challenges requires \"targeted architectural innovations\" in MH-PSCs, tailored to specific applications, to drive their practical deployment forward. This study reviews four innovative PSC architectures-Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) PSCs, Lateral Configuration (LC) PSCs, Fiber-Shaped (FS) PSCs, and Substrate-Configuration (SC) PSCs-highlighting their design advancements for enhanced efficiency, flexibility, lightweight, and application-specific integration.

This is particularly true for 'logistically difficult species' where their cryptic natures, low abundance, patchy distributions and difficult and/or dangerous sampling environments, make traditional surveys near impossible. What results is a lack of ecological knowledge on such marine species. However, advances in UAV technology holds potential for overcoming these logistical difficulties and filling this knowledge gap. Our research focused on one such logistically difficult species, the Australian box Jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri), and we investigated the capacity of consumer grade UAV technology to detect this, highly venomous, target species in the inshore waters of Northern Queensland Australia. At two sites in the Weipa area, we utilized video analysis, visual count comparisons with a netted animal tally, and evaluated the role of associated environmental conditions, such as wind speed, water visibility and cloud cover on jellyfish detection rates. In total fifteen, 70 meter transects were completed between two sites, with 107 individuals captured. Drone success varied between the two sites with a significant difference between field and post-field (laboratory) counts. Animal size and cloud cover also had significant effects on detection rates with an increase in cloud cover and animal size enhancing detection probability. This study provides evidence to suggest drone surveys overcome obstacles that traditional surveys can't, with respect to species deemed logistically difficult and open scope for further ecological investigations on such species.

Most existing works restrict the launch and recovery of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to customer locations (or nodes) in the delivery network. Nevertheless, emerging technological advances can allow drones to autonomously launch/land from a moving vehicle. In addition, majority of the current literature assumes multiple UAVs to be deployed and/or recovered simultaneously, thereby ignoring the associated scheduling decisions, which are essential to ensure safe, collision-free operations. This research introduces the single truck multi-drone routing and scheduling problem with en route operations for last-mile parcel delivery. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to minimize the delivery completion time. In addition, a variant is introduced to minimize the total delivery cost. Since the problem under consideration is NP-hard, a relax-and-fix with re-couple-refine-and-optimize (RF-RRO) heuristic approach is proposed, where the associated decisions (truck routing and drone scheduling) are decomposed into two stages and solved sequentially. Besides, a deep learning-based clustering procedure is developed to establish an initial solution and accelerate the convergence speed of the RF-RRO heuristic. Notably, the proposed approach is extended to solve a multi-truck multi-drone variant using a deep learning-based cluster-first route-second heuristic. Our numerical results show that the proposed MILP model is able to solve problem instances with up to 20 customers optimally in a reasonable time. The proposed RF-RRO heuristic can achieve optimal (or near-optimal) solutions for small instances and is computationally efficient for large cases. Extensive experimental analysis shows 30% average savings in delivery completion time, and an average drone utilization of 62% if en route drone operations are considered. In addition, numerical results provide insights on the impact of heterogeneous drone fleet and customer density.

Remote sensing of maize nitrogen deficiency may be one way to move nitrogen fertilizer applications closer to the specific nitrogen requirement. Six vegetation indices [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI), triangle greenness index (TGI), normalized area vegetation index (NAVI) and chlorophyll index-green (CIgreen)] were evaluated for their ability to detect nitrogen deficiency and predict grain maize grain yield. Strip trials were established at two locations in Arkansas, USA, with nitrogen rate as the primary treatment. Remote sensing data was collected weekly with an unmanned aerial system (UAS) equipped with a multispectral and thermal sensor. Relationships among index value, nitrogen fertilizer rate and maize growth stage were evaluated. Green NDVI, RENDVI and CIgreen had the strongest relationship with nitrogen fertilizer treatment. Chlorophyll Index-green and GNDVI were the best predictors of maize grain yield early in the growing season when the application of additional nitrogen was still agronomically feasible.

In this study, a collaborative truck-and-drone system was developed as a post-disaster assessment tool for use by humanitarian relief networks. The proposed system comprises a drone equipped with a camera that can launch from a truck to collect information from both nodes and links of a post-disaster transportation network. Following drone operation, the truck is used to retrieve and recharge the drone's battery. To optimize this collaborative truck-and-drone system, we focused on the routing problem with the objective of maximizing the value of information collected from nodes and links within a predefined time limit, a problem made challenging by the need to determine the routes of the truck and drone in an integrated manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to consider the problem of collaborative truck-and-drone routing optimization with the goal of profit maximization. After formulating the proposed problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, we decomposed the problem structure into a path-based master problem and two sub-problems to allow the use of a column generation (CG) framework to tackle the problem. Numerical experiments were conducted to examine the proposed model and algorithm at various instance sizes that were generated by modifying an existing benchmark, with the results indicating that the proposed algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions with optimality gaps of less than 10% for all terminated instances within predefined time limit. A real-world instance-the Kartal district of Istanbul-was then used to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model. Finally, the results of the numerical analysis were used to develop managerial insights for application by humanitarian relief agencies.

A predefined number of locations are to be selected among a set of potential locations. Each facility is used in the relief distribution operation. It is incontrovertible that due to earthquakes, some network edges collapse and corresponding areas may lose their accessibility. Thus in this study, it is assumed that people on intact and accessible edges travel to the location of the distribution centers to receive the relief.

Although conventional radar systems can detect large areas, they face challenges in accurately identifying small drones. In contrast, vision sensors offer high-resolution identification but encounter challenges in long-range detection and real-time processing. To address these limitations, this study proposes a vision sensor-based detection framework, termed the noise suppression super-resolution detector (NSSRD). To ensure the reliability and real-time capability of small drone detection, NSSRD integrates image segmentation, noise suppression, super-resolution transformation, and efficient detection processes. NSSRD divides the surveillance area into uniform sections, applies a bilateral filter to suppress noise before passing the images to an object detection model, and uses a region of interest selection process to reduce the detection area and computational load. The experimental results demonstrate that NSSRD outperforms existing models, achieving a 24% improvement in the true positive rate and a 25% increase in recall at an altitude of 40 m, validating its superior performance.

In this optimization problem, a fleet of multi-pur pose drones, aerial vehicles that can both make deliveries and conduct sensing activities (e.g., imaging), have to jointly visit a set of nodes to make deliveries and map one or more continuous areas. This problem is motivated by global healthcare applica-tions that deploy multipurpose drones that combine delivery trips with collection of aerial imaging data for use in emergency preparedness and resilience planning. The continuous areas that have to be mapped may correspond to terrain surfaces (e.g., flooded areas or regions with a disease outbreak) or to infrastructure networks to be inspected. The continuous areas can be modeled as a set of lines so that each area is completely serviced if all the lines covering it are traversed. Thus, given a set of nodes and a set of lines, the problem is to design drone routes of shortest total duration traversing the lines and visiting the nodes, while not exceeding the range limit (flight time) and capacity (loading) of the drones. Unlike ground vehicles in classical routing problems, drones can enter a line through any of its points, service only a part of that line and then exit through another of its points. The possibility of flying directly between any two points of the network offered by drones can lead to reduced costs, but it increases the difficulty of the problem. To deal with this problem, the lines are discretized, allowing drones to enter and exit each line only at a finite set of points, thus obtaining an instance of the K-vehicles general routing problem (K-GRP). We present in this article an integer programming formulation for the K-GRP and propose a matheuristic algorithm and a branch-and-cut proce-dure for its solution.

Unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones are an emerging technology that are very useful to cope with rising customer expectations of fast, flexible, and reliable delivery services. Drones work in tandem with trucks to perform parcel delivery, which have proven to reduce costs, CO2 emissions, and delivery times. This research proposes a mixed integer programming formulation to address the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drone (VRPD) by assigning customers to drone-truck pairs, determining the number of dispatching drone-truck units, and obtaining optimal service routes while the fixed and travel costs of both vehicles are minimized. Given the NP-hard nature of the VRPD, an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is elaborated to solve this problem. Two novel methods are proposed to investigate the efficiency of the drone-truck combination by allowing the drones to perform additional delivery services to only one feasible customer and also multiple feasible customers while the truck waits at a customer location. Experimental results show that the proposed ACO algorithm can effec-tively solve the VRDP for different size instances and different customer location distributions, and is successful in providing timely solutions for small test instances within 1% of the optimal solutions. Finally, experimentation also reveals that the ACO algorithm outperforms the classical VRP by obtaining cost-savings of over 30% for large instances.

Firstly, based on the requirements of task execution and constraints of UAV flight, a fitness function for real-time search of waypoints is designed while ensuring the safety and obstacle avoidance of the UAV. Then, to improve the search accuracy and real-time performance, determining the initial search direction in the BAS algorithm is improved, while the search step size and antennae sensing length are updated in real-time according to the distance between the UAV and the obstacle. Finally, the SA algorithm is combined with the BAS algorithm to update the waypoints, expanding the search range of each waypoint, avoiding the process of updating the waypoints from becoming trapped in the local optimal waypoints. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the next waypoint is evaluated based on the Metropolis criterion. This paper generates a virtual urban logistics distribution environment based on the density and distribution of urban buildings, and compares the performance of algorithms in obstacle-sparse, obstacle-moderate, and obstacle-dense environments. The simulation results demonstrate that the improved method in this paper has a more significant capacity for environmental adaptation. In terms of the path length, waypoints, safety obstacle avoidance, and smoothness, the planned path outperforms the original BAS method.

Coastal morphodynamics and associated sediment transport at the Arctic fjord head remain relatively unexplored due to the logistically limited accessibility to the field area, especially at short-term temporal scales. A repeat survey using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted photogrammetry was conducted to quantify the annual morphodynamics of gravel spit complexes developed on the tidal delta plain of the deglaciated Dicksonfjorden, Svalbard of Arctic. Results show that the spit morphodynamics varies in time and space with an overall downfjord increase in the growth and migration rate of the spits. The youngest spits elongated 22 m yr(-1) and migrated landward 4.3 m yr(-1) between 2015 and 2019, marking the most pronounced spit morphodynamics documented to date in the Svalbard fjord systems. The spit morphodynamics is driven primarily by longshore drift and to a lesser degree by overwash processes. Gravels constituting the spits originate from the unconsolidated debris-flow deposits of old alluvial fans, which locally retreat 0.5 m yr? 1. The growth of the spit complexes is also fed by snow meltwater discharge on the alluvial fans, accounting for a downfjord imbrication of angular gravel layers that are intercalated with interlaminated sands and muds on the landward sides of the spits. The breached spits at the most upfjord location have remained stationary during the study period and presumably since the 1930s. Rapid delta progradation combined with an isostatic rebound after the Little Ice Age (LIA) has decreased spit morphodynamics on the tidal delta plain upfjord in Dicksonfjorden with infrequent and insignificant wave influence. Sparse distribution of the isolated spits signifies the intermittent spit development, which is constrained by the proximity to the protruded alluvial fans. The spit complexes in Dicksonfjorden highlight that climate change accelerates coastal geomorphic changes at the fjord head by enhancing wave intensity and regulating episodic sediment delivery that led to the downfjord shift in the locus of wave shoaling.

These methods can be costly, logistically challenging in remote locations, dangerous to researchers, and disturbing to the animals. The growing use of imagery from satellite and unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) can help address some of these challenges, complementing crewed surveys and allowing for more frequent and evenly distributed surveys, especially for remote locations. However, manual counts in satellite and UAS imagery remain time and labor intensive, but the automation of image analyses offers promising solutions.

The performance of studies is quantitatively compared with metrics that evaluate false positives and false negatives from automated detection against manual counts of animals, which allows for a better assessment of the impact of miscounts in conservation contexts. In general, methods that relied solely on statistical differences in the spectral responses of animals and their surroundings performed worse than studies that used convolutional neural networks (CNN). Despite mixed results, CNN showed promise, and its use and evaluation should continue. Overall, while automation can reduce time and labor, more research is needed to improve the accuracy of automated counts. With the current state of knowledge, it is best to use semi-automated approaches that involve user revision of the output. These approaches currently enable the best tradeoff between time effort and detection accuracy. Based on our analysis, we identified thermal infrared UAS imagery as a future research avenue for marine mammal detection and also recommend the further exploration of object-based image analysis (OBIA). Our analysis also showed that past studies have focused on the automated detection of baleen whales and pinnipeds and that there is a gap in studies looking at toothed whales, polar bears, sirenians, and mustelids.

{"TI": "Assessing the sustainability of using drone technology for last-mile delivery in a blood supply chain", "DE": "Sustainability; Blood supply chain; Drone technology; Last-mile delivery; Preemptive fuzzy goal programming", "AB": "Purpose Delivery management of perishable products such as blood in a supply chain is a considerable issue such that the last-mile delivery, which refers to deliver goods to the end user as fast as possible takes into account as one of the most important, expensive and, polluting segments in the entire supply chain. Regardless of economic challenges, the last-mile delivery faces social and environmental barriers to continuing operations while complying with environmental and social standards, therefore incorporating sustainability into last-mile logistic strategy is no longer an option but rather a necessity. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to consider a last-mile delivery in a blood supply chain in terms of using appropriate technologies such as drones to assess sustainability. Design/methodology/approach The authors discuss the impact of drone technology on last-mile delivery and its importance in achieving sustainability. They focus on the effect of using drones on CO2 emission, costs and social benefits by proposing a multi-objective mathematical model to assess sustainability in the last-mile delivery. A preemptive fuzzy goal programming approach to solve the model and measure the achievement degree of sustainability is conducted by using a numerical example to show the capability and usefulness of the suggested model, solution approach and, impact of drone technology in achieving all three aspects of sustainability. Findings The findings illustrate the achievement degree of sustainability in the delivery of blood based on locating distribution centers and allocating drones. Moreover, a comparison between drones and conventional vehicles is carried out to show the preference of using drones in reaching sustainability. A sensitivity analysis on aspects of sustainability and specifications of drone technology is conducted for validating the obtained results and distinguishing the most dominant aspect and parameters in enhancing the achievement degree of sustainability. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, no research has considered the assessment of sustainability in the last-mile delivery of blood supply chain with a focus on drone technology.

{"TI": "Ultra-low-power backscatter-based software-defined radio for intelligent and simplified IoT network", "DE": "Backscatter; Ultra-low-power SDR; IoT networks; TN926", "AB": "The recent decade has witnessed an upsurge in the demands of intelligent and simplified Internet of Things (IoT) networks that provide ultra-low-power communication for numerous miniaturized devices. Although the research community has paid great attention to wireless protocol designs for these networks, researchers are handicapped by the lack of an energy-efficient software-defined radio (SDR) platform for fast implementation and experimental evaluation. Current SDRs perform well in battery-equipped systems, but fail to support miniaturized IoT devices with stringent hardware and power constraints. This paper takes the first step toward designing an ultra-low-power SDR that satisfies the ultra-low-power or even battery-free requirements of intelligent and simplified IoT networks. To achieve this goal, the core technique is the effective integration of mu W-level backscatter in our SDR to sidestep power-hungry active radio frequency chains. We carefully develop a novel circuit design for efficient energy harvesting and power control, and devise a competent solution for eliminating the harmonic and mirror frequencies caused by backscatter hardware. We evaluate the proposed SDR using different modulation schemes, and it achieves a high data rate of 100 kb/s with power consumption less than 200 mu W in the active mode and as low as 10 mu W in the sleep mode. We also conduct a case study of railway inspection using our platform, achieving 1 kb/s battery-free data delivery to the monitoring unmanned aerial vehicle at a distance of 50 m in a real-world environment, and provide two case studies on smart factories and logistic distribution to explore the application of our platform.

{"TI": "Evaluation of the use of drones to monitor a diverse crocodylian assemblage in West Africa", "DE": "Crocodylus; Mecistops; suchus; elephant; UAV; Pendjari", "AB": "Context. West African crocodylian populations are declining and in need of conservation action. Surveys and other monitoring methods are critical components of crocodile conservation programs; however, surveys are often hindered by logistical, financial and detectability constraints. Increasingly used in wildlife monitoring programs, drones can enhance monitoring and conservation efficacy. Aims. This study aimed to determine a standard drone crocodylian survey protocol and evaluate the drones as a tool to survey the diverse crocodylian assemblage of West Africa. Methods. We surveyed crocodile populations in Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Niger in 2017 and 2018, by using the DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone and via traditional diurnal and nocturnal spotlight surveys. We used a series of test flights to first evaluate the impact of drones on crocodylian behaviour and determine standard flight parameters that optimise detectability. We then, consecutively, implemented the three survey methods at 23 sites to compare the efficacy of drones against traditional crocodylian survey methods. Key results. Crocodylus suchus can be closely approached (>10 m altitude) and consumer-grade drones do not elicit flight responses in West African large mammals and birds at altitudes of >40-60 m. Altitude and other flight parameters did not affect detectability, because high-resolution photos allowed accurate counting. Observer experience, field conditions (e.g. wind, sun reflection), and site characteristics (e.g. vegetation, homogeneity) all significantly affected detectability. Drone-based crocodylian surveys should be implemented from 40 m altitude in the first third of the day. Comparing survey methods, drones performed better than did traditional diurnal surveys but worse than standard nocturnal spotlight counts. The latter not only detected more individuals, but also a greater size-class diversity. However, drone surveys provide advantages over traditional methods, including precise size estimation, less disturbance, and the ability to cover greater and more remote areas. Drone survey photos allow for repeatable and quantifiable habitat assessments, detection of encroachment and other illegal activities, and leave a permanent record. Conclusions. Overall, drones offer a valuable and cost-effective alternative for surveying crocodylian populations with compelling secondary benefits, although they may not be suitable in all cases and for all species. Implications. We propose a standardised and optimised protocol for drone-based crocodylian surveys that could be used for sustainable conservation programs of crocodylians in West Africa and globally.

Even though the reduced response time achieved with UASs can be lifesaving in critical situations, their usage must comply with technological constraints such as range, speed and capacity, while minimizing potential risks. In this paper, the feasibility of a drone operation dedicated to the transport of blood samples in an urban area is studied through a safety risk analysis. The assessment utilizes the Specific Operation Risk Assessment (SORA) framework, in line with current European regulations, and extends it to define flight trajectories with minimal risk. A case study in the Helsinki urban area is used as a reference, with an exemplary case of commercial drone transportation of blood samples between the T & ouml;& ouml;l & ouml; and Malmi Hospitals. By leveraging the drone performance capabilities and minimizing the risk for people on the ground, this approach demonstrates that medical delivery using drones in densely populated urban environments remains challenging. Nonetheless, it argues that the proposed method can enhance risk awareness and support the planning of feasible operations.

To overcome the difficulties caused by the comparatively short operating ranges of drones, an innovative concept suggests to apply trucks as mobile landing and take-off platforms. In this context, the paper on hand schedules the delivery to customers by drones for given truck routes. Given a fixed sequence of stops constituting a truck route and a set of customers to be supplied, we aim at a drone schedule (i.e., a set of trips each defining a drone's take-off and landing stop and the customer serviced), such that all customers are supplied and the total duration of the delivery tour is minimized. We differentiate whether multiple drones or just a single one are placed on a truck and whether or not take-off and landing stops have to be identical. We provide an analysis of computational complexity for each resulting subproblem, introduce efficient mixed-integer programs, and compare all cases with regard to their potential of reducing the delivery effort on the last mile.

Breeding programs in several countries are attempting to produce high-yielding Miscanthus hybrids better adapted to different climates and end-uses. Multispectral images acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Italy and in the UK in 2021 and 2022 were used to investigate the feasibility of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) of novel Miscanthus hybrids for yield prediction and crop traits estimation. An intercalibration procedure was performed using simulated data from the PROSAIL model to link vegetation indices (VIs) derived from two different multispectral sensors. The random forest algorithm estimated with good accuracy yield traits (light interception, plant height, green leaf biomass, and standing biomass) using 15 VIs time series, and predicted yield using peak descriptors derived from these VIs time series with root mean square error of 2.3 Mg DM ha(-1). The study demonstrates the potential of UAVs' multispectral images in HTP applications and in yield prediction, providing important information needed to increase sustainable biomass production.

Investigations into the effects of aeromedical transportation on blood products have found minimal blood product degradation when appropriately thermoregulated and delivered in a manner that minimizes trauma. UAV delivery of blood products is now actively being explored by numerous entities around the globe.

The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., drones) in electronic products after-sales service operations is a prominent example. With drones, the products that need after-sales services (e.g., repairment) can be delivered between the company store and consumers without requiring consumers to visit the store, which not only enhances consumer satisfaction but also helps improve environmental sustainability as fewer electronic products will be abandoned with the higher after-sales service levels. However, how to optimize drone-aided after-sales operations is still under-explored. An efficient decision support system may leverage the performance of the new service model. This work thus develops a new drone-aided after-sales service optimization model and proposes efficient solution algorithms. In particular, the company provides quick pick-up, repair, and delivery services through online reservation platforms. The store uses drones to perform pick-up and delivery services, and a set of technicians is available to perform the repair tasks. Given a set of service requests, the store must schedule limited resources, i.e., technicians and drones, to maximize the total profit of a workday. We formally describe the scheduling problem under this new model and formulate it as a mixed-integer linear programming model. We then show how the problem can be piece-wisely transformed into a variant of the flexible job shop scheduling problem. We propose several new formulations based on this idea. To handle practical-sized instances, we develop a new fix-and-solve matheuristic that consists of a sorting rule determination process and an approximate model solving process. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models and matheuristic. Sensitivity analyses are also performed to provide useful and practical implications for decision-makers. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

{"TI": "Integrating high resolution drone imagery and forest inventory to distinguish canopy and understory trees and quantify their contributions to forest structure and dynamics", "AB": "Tree growth and survival differ strongly between canopy trees (those directly exposed to overhead light), and understory trees. However, the structural complexity of many tropical forests makes it difficult to determine canopy positions. The integration of remote sensing and ground-based data enables this determination and measurements of how canopy and understory trees differ in structure and dynamics. Here we analyzed 2 cm resolution RGB imagery collected by a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), also known as drone, together with two decades of bi-annual tree censuses for 2 ha of old growth forest in the Central Amazon. We delineated all crowns visible in the imagery and linked each crown to a tagged stem through field work. Canopy trees constituted 40% of the 1244 inventoried trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 10 cm, and accounted for similar to 70% of aboveground carbon stocks and wood productivity. The probability of being in the canopy increased logistically with tree diameter, passing through 50% at 23.5 cm DBH. Diameter growth was on average twice as large in canopy trees as in understory trees. Growth rates were unrelated to diameter in canopy trees and positively related to diameter in understory trees, consistent with the idea that light availability increases with diameter in the understory but not the canopy. The whole stand size distribution was best fit by a Weibull distribution, whereas the separate size distributions of understory trees or canopy trees > 25 cm DBH were equally well fit by exponential and Weibull distributions, consistent with mechanistic forest models. The identification and field mapping of crowns seen in a high resolution orthomosaic revealed new patterns in the structure and dynamics of trees of canopy vs. understory at this site, demonstrating the value of traditional tree censuses with drone remote sensing.

However, many challenges are still to be addressed with PAM: difficulty in accessing research sites, the logistics of implementing large-scale studies and the invasiveness of data collection. When combined with PAM and other sensing strategies, mobile robotics are a promising solution to directly address these challenges. In this paper, we integrate water surface and underwater acoustic monitoring equipment onto a prototype unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicle (UAAV) capable of sailing and flight (SailMAV). Twelve autonomous sailing missions were run on Lake Vrana, Croatia, during which acoustic data were collected, and the ability of the UAAV to facilitate the collection of acoustic data demonstrated. Data were simultaneously collected using standard recording methods on buoys and banksides to provide a comparative approach. Acoustic indices were used to analyse the soundscape of underwater acoustic data and BirdNET (a deep artificial neural network) was used on water surface datasets to determine bird species composition. Results show higher species richness and call abundance from UAAV surveys and high site dissimilarity owing to turnover between stationary and UAAV methods. This highlights the success of the UAAV in detecting biodiversity and the complementarity of these methods in providing a broad picture of the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems. Increased bird diversity and underwater acoustic activity in protected areas demonstrate the benefits of protecting freshwater ecosystems; however, site dissimilarity driven by turnover highlights the importance of protecting the entire ecosystem.

Recently, collaborative distribution using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground vehicles has been considered as a means of reducing costs and enhancing efficiency, thus overcoming the issues created by the high-density layout of enterprises' relatively independent networks. This essentially involves constructing an air-ground collaborative common distribution network. To optimize the economic cost and distribution time of network operations, we established a site selection planning model for air-ground cooperative urban co-distribution centers and designed a solution method based on gray wolf optimization with K-means clustering. Taking the Wangsheren area of Jinan City, China, as an example, 15 UAV co-distribution centers and 13 vehicle co-distribution centers were identified. Although the average distribution cost of the network rose by 35-50% compared to traditional terminal distribution, the time saving was 80-85%, greatly improving the high-value-added service capacity. The end-distribution efficiency and customer satisfaction were also enhanced, which fully verifies the feasibility, validity, and applicability of the proposed model. Our approach can be applied to landing sites and the planning and optimization of large-scale commercial operations using logistics UAVs in urban areas.

In this context, the salesman represents the driver of a home delivery truck. Given a set of customers to be visited, the truck has a limited capacity, so that only a subset of shipments can be loaded on board when leaving the depot. The remainder of the shipments has to be resupplied to the truck on its tour by a single unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). In order to do so, the drone picks up shipments (one by one) at the depot and delivers them toward the truck. Our extension of the TSP aims at a tour of the truck through the set of given customers and a resupply schedule for the drone, so that the total delivery costs are minimized. We develop suited optimization approaches and apply them in static and dynamic problem settings. We, furthermore, benchmark the savings enabled by drone resupply with alternative home delivery options with and without drone support. Our results show that drone resupply promises substantial rewards when applied in the right delivery context.

The controllability of drone aircraft and quality cameras, even in less expensive aerial models, offers opportunities for students to learn and collect their own imagery for a variety of applications. This opportunity can be taught with an active learning approach. The challenge for instructors is to cover the three fundamentals in the remote sensing workflow - planning, collection, and image processing - while minimizing logistical issues associated with actual flight operation. The logistical issues (e.g. policy, legal, safety, weather) for an outdoor aerial drone learning experience are quite daunting, particularly for urban campuses with local/state restrictions on the use of drone aircraft. In this article, we separate the fundamental learning concepts in the remote sensing workflow from the flight operation and provide a learning environment for unlimited experiments. Using a synthetic indoor scaled landscape, students are given the opportunity for repeat experiments in a tightly controlled environment, saving the focus on actual flight operation for later times in the semester. The advantages of the indoor landscape are many, and also minimize the logistical issues for actual flight operation. C1 [Hodgson, Michael E.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.

To ensure the stable and reliable operation of UASs, fault diagnosis is essential, which can enhance safety, and minimize potential risks and losses. However, most existing fault diagnosis methods rely on a single physical quantity as the primary information source or solely consider fault data at a single moment, leading to challenges of low diagnostic accuracy and limited reliability. Aimed at this problem, this paper presents a fault diagnosis method based on time-space domain weighted information fusion for UASs. First, the Gaussian fault model is constructed for the data with different fault features in the space domain. Next, the weighted coefficient method is used to generate the basic probability assignment (BPA) by matching the fault data with the Gaussian fault model. Then, the Dempster's combination rule, which enables the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, is adopted to fuse the generated BPAs. Based on this, the pignistic probability transformation is performed to determine the fault type. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method in accurately identifying the fault types of UASs.

Drone deliveries have a two-pronged advantage as they have the potential to lessen delivery time by avoiding traffic congestions, and the inherent structure that reduces its carbon footprint compared to traditional modes of transportation under some restrictions. To leverage this potential, many companies across the world have developed and tested drones for real-world applications. However, many factors may play a significant role in the adoption of drone-delivery in the logistics sector. This paper attempts to unearth such critical success factors and establish the interrelationships between these factors. Twelve critical success factors were identified by systematically reviewing the literature and taking inputs from experts. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making technique, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)', combined with the Grey-based approach, was used to envisage causal relationships between the identified critical success factors. The results reveal that 'Technological advancements' and 'Government regulations' are the most influential factors that impact the adoption of drones in the logistics sector.

This research adopts a dual approach, combining rigorous theoretical analysis with detailed practical simulations to assess the performance, adaptability, and efficiency of FANETs in varying conditions. The findings emphasize the ability of FANETs to manage network congestion effectively in densely populated areas, a critical feature for maintaining reliable communications in complex scenarios. Moreover, FANETs demonstrate high potential to support critical applications, such as emergency response, disaster management, and public safety operations, where quick and coordinated action is paramount. The study also underscores the importance of establishing a hierarchical structure among nodes within the network, which allows for more efficient data exchange and helps optimize the overall network performance. Through this work, significant insights are offered into the design principles that can enhance UAV communication networks, providing a foundation for the development of more resilient, scalable, and efficient technological solutions. These advancements could accelerate the deployment of UAVs across a variety of sectors, including logistics, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and more.

In the industrial areas of smart city, the IoT focuses on industrial applications, such as logistics and environmental monitoring. In this work, an auxiliary position analysis framework composed of IoT and distributed mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed to analyze the position of vehicles in the industrial areas of smart city. In the proposed framework, IoT are deployed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with uniform linear array (ULA), which receives the signal emitted by vehicles for obtaining the direction of arrival (DOA), and the distributed MEC provides computing and synchronization services to auxiliary positioning. The DOA estimation is a key issue for auxiliary positioning in the proposed framework. To realize DOA estimation with unknown mutual coupling (MC) existing in IoT nodes, a novel block sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is developed. In the developed algorithm, the unknown MC existing between sensors in each IoT nodes is first fused with the signal by parameterizing steering vector. Then, a block SBL (BSBL) procedure is presented to perform DOA estimation by using the inherent block sparse structure in the equivalent signal obtained after fusion. Benefiting from the fusion of MC and signal, the developed DOA estimation algorithm does not require a separate estimation of the unknown MC and also does not cause the loss of the array aperture. Based on the DOA estimation information, the position of vehicles in the industrial environment is effectively analyzed through weighted multiple cross-locations. Synthetic data set simulation is carried out to verify that the vehicle positions in smart city can be efficiently analyzed and estimated based on the presented framework and algorithm.

{"TI": "Considering both energy effectiveness and flight safety in UAV trajectory planning for intelligent logistics", "DE": "Intelligent logistics; UAV trajectory planning; Intelligent optimization algorithm; Deep Q-network; Artificial potential field", "AB": "In low-altitude economic logistics scenarios, trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be treated as a typical traveling salesman problem (TSP). High-rise buildings in urban areas not only severely impact the flight safety of UAVs, but also increase their energy consumption when avoiding obstacles, thereby affecting their delivery ranges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage trajectory planning solution called ACO-DQN-TP for logistics UAVs. In the first stage, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is applied to solve the sequence for multi-target point deliveries, to obtain the optimal flight paths. The ant tabu table is reopened to allow for retracing of the movement paths in order to avoid forward search dilemmas. In the second stage, a deep Q-network (DQN) is combined with the traditional artificial potential field method to enhance the interaction between UAVs and their environment. The rewards are accumulated using two potential functions generated based on the target points and obstacles, to minimize the changes in the yaw angles and smooth the flight trajectory of the UAV. Simulation experiments were conducted on UAV trajectory planning for delivery missions with four to ten target points. The simulation results show that the average path length obtained by ACO-DQN-TP is 65% and 79% shorter than that of Greedy +DQNPF and BACO, respectively, and the sum of turning angles along the path is 56% of Greedy DQNPF and 72% of BACO on average. It indicates that the proposed ACO-DQN-TP scheme not only optimizes delivery routes compared to traditional ACOs but also effectively controls the magnitude of the changes in heading angle during flight. This ensures flight safety for the UAV through obstacle avoidance while reducing flight energy consumption. In particular, the heading angle optimization mechanism proposed in this paper has universal guiding significance for low-altitude flights in the areas of traffic and transportation using UAVs.

In remote regions, regular habitat assessments are logistically challenging and time consuming. Drones are increasingly being used by ecologists to conduct habitat assessments, but reliance on georeferenced data as ground truth may not always be feasible. We estimated goose habitat degradation using photointerpretation of drone imagery and compared estimates to those made with ground-based linear transects. In July 2016, we surveyed five study plots in La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, to evaluate the effectiveness of a fixed-wing drone with simple Red Green Blue (RGB) imagery for evaluating habitat degradation by snow geese. Ground-based land cover data was collected and grouped into barren, shrub, or non-shrub categories. We compared estimates between ground-based transects and those made from unsupervised classification of drone imagery collected at altitudes of 75, 100, and 120 m above ground level (ground sampling distances of 2.4, 3.2, and 3.8 cm respectively). We found large time savings during the data collection step of drone surveys, but these savings were ultimately lost during imagery processing. Based on photointerpretation, overall accuracy of drone imagery was generally high (88.8% to 92.0%) and Kappa coefficients were similar to previously published habitat assessments from drone imagery. Mixed model estimates indicated 75m drone imagery overestimated barren (F-2,F-182 = 100.03, P < 0.0001) and shrub classes (F-2,F-182 = 160.16, P < 0.0001) compared to ground estimates. Inconspicuous graminoid and forb species (non-shrubs) were difficult to detect from drone imagery and were underestimated compared to ground-based transects (F-2,F-182 = 843.77, P < 0.0001). Our findings corroborate previous findings, and that simple RGB imagery is useful for evaluating broad scale goose damage, and may play an important role in measuring habitat destruction by geese and other agents of environmental change.

However, the large-scale operation of logistics UAVs has brought challenges to air traffic management, and the competitiveness of UAV logistics is still weak compared with traditional ground logistics. Therefore, this paper constructs a double-layer route network structure that separates logistics transshipment from terminal delivery. In the delivery layer, a door-to-door distribution mode is adopted, and the transshipment node service location model is constructed, so as to obtain the location of the transshipment node and the service relationship. In the transshipment layer, the index of the route betweenness standard deviation (BSD) is introduced to construct the route network planning model. In order to solve the above model, a double-layer algorithm was designed. In the upper layer, the multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm (MOSA) is used to solve the transshipment node service location issue, and in the lower layer, the multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is adopted to solve the network planning model. Based on real obstacle data and the demand situation, the double-layer network was constructed through simulation experiments. To verify the network rationality, actual flights were carried out on some routes, and it was found that the gap between the UAV's autonomous flight route time and the theoretical calculations was relatively small. The simulation results show that compared with the single-layer network, the total distance with the double-layer network was reduced by 62.5% and the structural intersection was reduced by 96.9%. Compared with the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm, the total task flight distance obtained with the NSGA-II was reduced by 42.4%. The BSD factors can mitigate potential congestion risks. The route network proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the number of intersections and make the UAV passing volume more balanced.

{"TI": "Plot-level satellite imagery can substitute for UAVs in assessing maize phenotypes across multistate field trials", "AB": "Societal Impact StatementMaize plays a key role in agricultural profitability and food security on six continents. Successful efforts to breed higher-yielding maize varieties depend on replicated yield trials in many environments. Capturing in-season data can help improve and accelerate the development of regionally adapted hybrids, but collecting these data can be impractical in many locations. We demonstrate that satellite remote sensing could play a similar role in crop performance assessment as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but with far lower labor costs and the greatest ease of collection at remote field sites. This dataset and benchmarks have the potential to enable predictive models that could guide farmers and crop breeders in decision-making.Summary Accurate early yield estimates at fields and plots offer potential benefits to farmers in optimizing their agronomic practices and breeders in screening thousands of varieties contributing to improving agriculture and food production systems. Effective approaches to track plant growth and predict yield require large datasets of remote sensing and ground truth data collected across multiple environments. Low-altitude drone flights are increasingly being used to collect data from field evaluations of new crop varieties, while satellite imagery is being explored to track yield and management practices at regional scales. Satellite platforms exhibit logistical and technical advantages in scalability and accessibility and could facilitate plot-level predictions, especially with steadily improving spatial resolution. However, plot-level, high-resolution satellite images capturing differences in genotypes from multiple environments with ground truth measurements are not publicly available. Here, we generated, described, and evaluated over 20,000 plot-level images of over 80 hybrid maize varieties grown across the US corn belt under various management practices collected from (near simultaneous) satellite and drone (synonym UAVs, UASs) flights integrated with ground truth yield measurement. Of the six baseline models examined, models employing data collected from satellite images often matched the performance of models employing drone images for both within and cross-environment yield prediction.

In recent decades, in the management of disasters and smart cities, fast and accurate extraction of roads, especially in emergencies, is quite important in terms of transportation, logistics planning, and route determination. In this study, automatic road extraction analyses were carried out using the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data set, belonging to the Yildiz Technical University Davutpasa Campus road route.

These values were obtained from confusion matrices for 4 target classes consisting of road and road elements namely road, road line, sidewalk, and bicycle road. Finally, integration of classified image objects with ontology was realized.

Blue whales employ an energetically demanding lunge feeding method that requires the whales to selectively feed where energetic gain exceeds energetic loss, while also balancing oxygen consumption, breath holding capacity, and surface recuperation time. Hence, blue whale foraging behavior is primarily driven by krill patch density and depth, but many studies have not fully considered surface feeding as a significant foraging strategy in energetic models. We collected predator and prey data on a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) foraging ground in New Zealand in February 2017 to assess the distributional and behavioral response of blue whales to the distribution and density of krill prey aggregations. Krill density across the study region was greater toward the surface (upper 20 m), and blue whales were encountered where prey was relatively shallow and more dense. This relationship was particularly evident where foraging and surface lunge feeding were observed. Furthermore, New Zealand blue whales also had relatively short dive times (2.83 +/- 0.27 SE min) as compared to other blue whale populations, which became even shorter at foraging sightings and where surface lunge feeding was observed. Using an unmanned aerial system (UAS; drone) we also captured unique video of a New Zealand blue whale's surface feeding behavior on well-illuminated krill patches. Video analysis illustrates the whale's potential use of vision to target prey, make foraging decisions, and orient body mechanics relative to prey patch characteristics. Kinematic analysis of a surface lunge feeding event revealed biomechanical coordination through speed, acceleration, head inclination, roll, and distance from krill patch to maximize prey engulfment. We compared these lunge kinematics to data previously reported from tagged blue whale lunges at depth to demonstrate strong similarities, and provide rare measurements of gape size, and krill response distance and time. These findings elucidate the predator-prey relationship between blue whales and krill, and provide support for the hypothesis that surface feeding by New Zealand blue whales is an important component to their foraging ecology used to optimize their energetic efficiency. Understanding how blue whales make foraging decisions presents logistical challenges, which may cause incomplete sampling and biased ecological knowledge if portions of their foraging behavior are undocumented. We conclude that surface foraging could be an important strategy for blue whales, and integration of UAS with tag-based studies may expand our understanding of their foraging ecology by examining surface feeding events in conjunction with behaviors at depth.

Next, we researched how these DTs can help drones exploit their capabilities to their full potential and facilitate the various drone operations deployed across different disaster scenarios, types, and stages. Last, the solving approaches employed by the models were examined. Overall, we shifted our research focus toward several overlooked aspects in the literature and identified multiple challenges needing to be addressed. Our work resulted in the formulation of a holistic framework aiming to standardize the cooperative utilization of DTs during the execution of humanitarian drone operations, so as to enhance their real-life application and scalability.

{"TI": "Drones address an observational blind spot for biological oceanography", "AB": "Marine biological communities are dynamic across many scales in both space and time. Such multi-scale complexity complicates efforts to fully characterize these communities. Critical processes unfold on the order of 0.1-10 kilometers and 0.1-10 days, but conventional oceanographic techniques generally do not observe or model at this scale. Small aerial drones conveniently achieve scales of observation between satellite resolutions and in-situ sampling, and effectively diminish the \"blind spot\" between these established measurement techniques. Despite this promise, drone-based techniques face challenges inherent to optical oceanography, as well as logistical and regulatory barriers relating to both aerial and marine operations. Such obstacles have slowed adoption of drones for marine biological study, but best practices are emerging alongside new techniques that facilitate robust study designs and rigorous data collection. With such advancements, drones promise to complement conventional approaches in biological oceanography to more fully capture the spatiotemporal complexity of the marine environment.

It proposes three objective functions that evaluate the network from the economic perspectives of network providers and users and the city residents' social point of view. Using geospatial data from Frankfurt, Germany, we conducted different experiments including and excluding the social objective function under a varying input set of pre-optimized paths. Our analysis showed that taking social aspects into account results in traffic networks whose increase in social acceptance far outweighs the extra monetary costs. We conclude that it is beneficial to integrate social criteria into optimization problems when the solutions obtained are the basis for decisions in the area of conflict between the economy and human welfare.

Given the logistic difficulties regarding field surveys in mangroves, remote sensing approaches have been considered a reliable alternative. We quantified trends in damage and early signs of canopy recovery in a fringe Rhizophora mangle area of Marismas Nacionales, Mexico, following the landfall of Hurricane Willa in October 2018. We monitored (2016-2021) broad canopy defoliation using 21 vegetation indices (VI) from the Google Earth Engine tool (GEE). We also mapped a detailed canopy fragmen-tation and developed digital surface models (DSM) during five study periods (2018-2021) with a consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over an area of 100 ha. Based on optical data from the GEE time series, results indicated an abrupt decline in the overall mangrove canopy. The VARI index was the most reliable VI for the mangrove canopy classification from a standard RGB sensor. The impact of the hurricane caused an overall canopy defoliation of 79%. The series of UAV orthomosaics indicate a gradual recovery in the mangrove canopy, while the linear model predicts at least 8.5 years to reach pre-impact mangrove cover conditions. However, the sequence of DSM estimates that the vertical canopy configuration will require a longer time to achieve its original structure.

Once UAVs must search through the entire affected area to find victims, the path-planning operation becomes equivalent to an area coverage problem. In this study, we propose an innovative method for solving such problem based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which considers the observations made from UAVs. The formulation of the UAV path planning is based on the idea of assigning higher priorities to the areas that are more likely to have victims. We applied the method to three illustrative cases, considering different types of disasters: a tornado in Brazil, a refugee camp in South Sudan, and a nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan. The results demonstrated that the POMDP solution achieves full coverage of disaster-affected areas within a reasonable time span. We evaluate the traveled distance and the operation duration (which were quite stable), as well as the time required to find groups of victims by a detailed multivariate sensitivity analysis. The comparisons with a Greedy Algorithm showed that the POMDP finds victims more quickly, which is the priority in humanitarian relief, whereas the performance of the Greedy focuses on minimizing the traveled distance. We also discuss the ethical, legal, and social acceptance issues that can influence the application of the proposed methodology in practice.

Unlike traditional commerce, which relies on a multi-layered supply chain, person-to-person transactions depend on courier companies for delivering the items, thus, it can be considered a third-party logistics scheme. The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, is ideal for this type of commerce, as most of the traded items are small-sized and light-weight. Logistic companies are already experimenting with using drones in their delivery operations, as their benefits are both financial and environmental. This paper, introduces the Energy Minimizing Drone Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries (EM-DRP-PD), to address scenarios of direct trading between individuals, where the logistics company provides the courier service using drones. The EM-DRP-PD focuses on minimizing the total energy consumption of operations and accounts for the range constraints imposed by the drones, which is influenced by the weight of the packages carried. The formulation of the EM-DRP-PD is presented. Three variants of a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure metaheuristic algorithm are implemented for solving the EM-DRP-PD. The algorithms are compared based on generated EM-DRP-PD benchmark instances ranging from 50 to 200 customers. The study compares both, energy and distance, objective approaches and discusses the results.

This study aims to identify these factors using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and address uncertainties in their prioritization through Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE). The utility of this approach lies in its ability to provide construction organizations with actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness through effective UAV adoption. Design/methodology/approach- A post-positivist philosophical stance was adopted, wherein quantitative data were gathered from construction professionals in Nigeria via a questionnaire survey. The collected data were analyzed using the Cronbach alpha test as a measure of internal consistency and the FSE test to synthesize critical drivers for the adoption of UAVs. Findings- The study found that drivers related to technology and organization are the most critical drivers. This implies that variables related to technology and organization warrant a higher level of focus if UAVs are to continue gaining popularity within the construction industry. Additionally, this study identified that logistic management, construction monitoring and site surveying represent the most critical areas of UAV application within the construction industry. Practical implications- The emphasis on technology and organizational drivers as critical factors suggests that construction companies should prioritize investments in technology infrastructure and cultivate an organizational culture that embraces innovation. This may involve providing training to construction professionals to enhance their technological skills and fostering a leadership culture that champions technology adoption. Originality/value- This study introduces novelty by applying the TOE framework, which has received limited attention in UAV adoption studies within construction. Additionally, the use of FSE addresses uncertainties in prioritizing critical drivers, particularly relevant in developing countries facing unique technological challenges. By assigning priority to these factors, this research lays the groundwork for a more informed and strategic approach to UAV adoption.

An example is represented by the logistics sector, where UAVs have been proven to be able to improve the efficiency of the process itself, as their cooperation with trucks can decrease the delivery time and reduce fuel consumption. In this paper, we first state a mathematical formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) applied to logistic routing, where a truck cooperates synchronously with multiple UAVs for parcel delivery. Then, we propose, implement, and compare different sub-optimal routing approaches to the formulated mFSTSP (multiple Flying Sidekick Travelling Salesman Problem) since the inherent combinatorial computational complexity of the problem makes it unattractable for commercial Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers. A local search algorithm, two hybrid genetic algorithms that permutate feasible and infeasible solutions, and an alternative ad-hoc greedy method are evaluated in terms of the total delivery time of the output schedule. For the sake of the evaluation, the savings in terms of delivery time over the well-documented truck-only TSP solution are investigated for each proposed routing solution, and this is repeated for two different scenarios. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the results. C1 [Rinaldi, Marco; Primatesta, Stefano; Guglieri, Giorgio] Politecn Torino, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.

Using remote sensing techniques to monitor macroalgae is a promising way of optimizing efforts in relation to logistics and personnel. This study aimed to quantify the cover and biomass of the predominant macroalgae in a rocky intertidal zone (of area 5.9 ha) in NW Spain. Drone monitoring with multispectral sensors, in situ photography and biomass sampling were conducted in June and July, 2021 (i.e. in summer, when macroalgae are most abundant in the study area). The macroalgae were classified using Minimum Distance, Spectral Angle Mapping and Maximum Likelihood algorithms, the latter of which proved the most accurate. The fresh weight of macroalgae determined in the quadrat sampling was regressed on the cover of July to enable subsequent estimation of biomass from the classification maps. The area occupied by brown algae (phylum Ochrophyta) in July 2021 was estimated to be 5574 m2 with a biomass of 28.5 t. The remote sensing method, which did not require in-depth knowledge of programming, proved to be a rapid, effective means of estimating macroalgal cover. The method may be useful for managing commercial macroalgal stocks and monitoring protected marine areas.

By using unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and laboratory analysis, our results revealed that the integration between UAS-RGB and physicochemical data can improve the estimation accuracy of tSHA distribution. Firstly, the UAS-RGB dataset was used to isolate bare soil from the vegetative radiometric contribution. Secondly, starting from statistical approaches (correlation matrices), the highest correlation with UAS-RGB and physicochemical data was stated. Thirdly, by using a geostatistical approach (ordinary cokriging), the map representing the tSHA variability was finally obtained.

With traditional methods exhausted, companies now see it worthwhile to explore fundamentally paradigm-shifting methods to create savings. For the logistics industry, one such approach is the incorporation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, into the delivery cycle, whose per-mile transportation costs are much lower than those of trucks, the traditional mode of transportation for deliveries. Yet despite the long-standing promise of drones to revolutionize the supply chain, realistic proposals for the exact ways in which UAVs would be introduced into delivery operations have only recently begun to appear in the operations research literature. Particularly noteworthy among these proposals is the concept of collaborative truck-and-drone operation, which captures the advantages of each of the two modes of delivery involved while attenuating their respective downsides. Over the past five years, collaborative delivery has been studied extensively in the classical contexts of the traveling salesman problem and the vehicle-routing problem. In this paper, we offer a first incursion into studying the incorporation of tandem truck-drone delivery into the inventory -routing problem (IRP)-a more realistic and more challenging operations model. After presenting a mixed integer-linear programming formulation for the IRP with drone (IRP-D), we propose an exact branch-and-cut solution approach for it. Additionally, a heuristic for the problem is designed based on the solution of the basic (i.e., droneless) IRP. Extensive computational results show that the heuristic is effective both as a standalone algorithm and as a warm-starting agent for the branch-and-cut IRP-D algorithm. We also demonstrate the contrast between the IRP-D and the basic IRP. C1 [Najy, Waleed; Diabat, Ali] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Div Engn, Abu Dhabi 129188, U Arab Emirates.

The FS-TSP is a variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation, where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10 customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some of them never solved before.

In this novel approach, they are deployed alongside trucks to deliver goods to customers to improve the quality of service and reduce the transportation cost. This approach gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called TSP with drone (TSP-D). A variant of this problem that aims to minimize the time at which truck and drone finish the service (or, in other words, to maximize the quality of service) was studied in the work of Murray and Chu (2015). In contrast, this paper considers a new variant of TSP-D in which the objective is to minimize operational costs including total transportation cost and one created by waste time a vehicle has to wait for the other. The problem is first formulated mathematically. Then, two algorithms are proposed for the solution. The first algorithm (TSP-LS) was adapted from the approach proposed by Murray and Chu (2015), in which an optimal TSP solution is converted to a feasible TSP-D solution by local searches. The second algorithm, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), is based on a new split procedure that optimally splits any TSP tour into a TSP-D solution. After a TSP-D solution has been generated, it is then improved through local search operators. Numerical results obtained on various instances of both objective functions with different sizes and characteristics are presented. The results show that GRASP outperforms TSP-IS in terms of solution quality under an acceptable running time.

Despite challenges in data acquisition due to occlusions and logistical constraints at high altitudes, this first TLS survey of a TP glacier provides invaluable insights into glacier dynamics.

There have been different methods trying to overcome the AUN task, and most of them have focused on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). But the results were still far from satisfactory, and even if the result was good, the environment was usually too trivial and simple. We report in this paper one of the causes of low success rate for AUN in our previous work, which is the apprehensive behavior of agents. After numerous episodes of training, when the agent faces risky scenes, it often moves back and forth repeatedly until running out of the limited steps. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new role, LifeGuard, into the popular DRL model, Actor-Critic, to tackle the apprehensive behavior and expect a better success rate. In addition, we developed a pilot method of unsupervised classification for sequential data to further enhance our reward function from previous work, augmentative backward reward function. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can eliminate the apprehensive behavior and gain higher success rates than the state-of-the-art method, FORK, with lesser effort.

Consequently, large-sized multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with strong power and ample space show great potential. In order to optimize the design process for large-sized multirotors and reduce physical trial and error, a detailed dynamic model is firstly established, with an accurate aerodynamic model. In addition, the center of gravity (CoG) offset and actuator dynamics are also well considered, which are usually ignored in small-sized multirotors. To improve the endurance and maneuverability of large-sized multirotors, which is the key concern in real applications, a two-loop optimization method for rotor tilt angle design is proposed based on the mathematical model established previously. Its inner loop solves the dynamic equilibrium points to relax the complex dynamic constraints caused by aerodynamics in the overall optimization problem, which improves the solution efficiency. The ideal design results can be obtained through the offline process, which greatly reduces the difficulties of physical trial and error. Finally, various experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the established model and the effectiveness of the optimization method.

Once the large vehicle has returned and another batch of small vehicles has been loaded at the depot, the process repeats until all customers are serviced. With autonomous driving on the verge of practical application, this general setting occurs whenever small autonomous delivery vehicles with limited operating range, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) or delivery robots, need to be brought in the proximity of the customers by a larger vehicle, e.g., a truck. We aim at the most elementary decision problem in this context, which is inspired by Amazon's novel last-mile concept, the flying warehouse. According to this concept, drones are launched from a flying warehouse and - after their return to an earthbound depot - are resupplied to the flying warehouse by an air shuttle. We formulate the Piggyback Transportation Problem, investigate its computational complexity, and derive suited solution procedures. From a theoretical perspective, we prove different im portant structural problem properties. From a practical point of view, we explore the impact of the two main cost drivers, the capacity of the large vehicle and the fleet size of small vehicles, on service quality. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

A four parameter logistic (4PL) curve is investigated as a prospective candidate and closed-form conditions are derived on the 4PL design parameters to satisfy the window traversability and vehicle dynamic feasibility constraints. A hierarchical approach first computes a dynamically feasible design parameter set for decoupled trajectory components and then obtains a solution set satisfying 3-D axis-coupled window traversability conditions.

{"TI": "Rapid retreat of permafrost coastline observed with aerial drone photogrammetry", "AB": "Permafrost landscapes are changing around the Arctic in response to climate warming, with coastal erosion being one of the most prominent and hazardous features. Using drone platforms, satellite images, and historic aerial photographs, we observed the rapid retreat of a permafrost coastline on Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. This coastline is adjacent to a gravel spit accommodating several culturally significant sites and is the logistical base for the Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island Territorial Park operations. In this study we sought to (i) assess short-term coastal erosion dynamics over fine temporal resolution, (ii) evaluate short-term shoreline change in the context of long-term observations, and (iii) demonstrate the potential of low-cost lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (\"drones\") to inform coastline studies and management decisions. We resurveyed a 500 m permafrost coastal reach at high temporal frequency (seven surveys over 40 d in 2017). Intra-seasonal shoreline changes were related to meteorological and oceanographic variables to understand controls on intra-seasonal erosion patterns. To put our short-term observations into historical context, we combined our analysis of shoreline positions in 2016 and 2017 with historical observations from 1952, 1970, 2000, and 2011. In just the summer of 2017, we observed coastal retreat of 14.5 m, more than 6 times faster than the long-term average rate of 2.2 +/- 0.1 ma(-1) (1952-2017). Coastline retreat rates exceeded 1.0 +/- 0.1 md(-1) over a single 4 d period. Over 40 d, we estimated removal of ca. 0.96 m(3) m(-1) d(-1). These findings highlight the episodic nature of shoreline change and the important role of storm events, which are poorly understood along permafrost coastlines. We found drone surveys combined with image-based modelling yield fine spatial resolution and accurately geolocated observations that are highly suitable to observe intra-seasonal erosion dynamics in rapidly changing Arctic landscapes.

Logistics companies especially keep trying to utilize drones for fast delivery following the growing market size of e-commerce. Accordingly, methods for safely operating multi-drone have been researched, and many researchers have proposed various optimal or near-optimal routing methods. However, such methods have some problems that cause routing failures or huge routing computation time in a drone-dense space due to many collisions. In this paper, we propose a centralized framework that deals with enormous collisions and obtains collision-free paths rapidly. We first build a drone energy consumption model with a data-driven method using flight experiment data of a commercial drone to estimate the drone battery state-of-charge (SoC). Then, we develop a novel routing method that generates collision-free paths by considering both the congestion of the space and the SoC of each drone. The proposed method is inspired by the VLSI circuit routing method that connects all signal nets among thousands of logic components. Through numerous delivery routing simulations, we confirm that the proposed method achieves a maximum of 6 times higher routing success rate with a 10x faster runtime compared with the state-of-the-art optimal method. In addition, we validate that the proposed method is applicable to delivery routing problems with various drone battery capacities.

Despite the potential benefits of drones, their use is not well established and practical challenges need to be understood. This study examines the role of drones in disaster management by analyzing various applications of drones in response to the Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024. Drones were used on the ground in a variety of new ways, including transport of emergency supplies, restore of cellphone communications, and inspect on damaged facilities. Several issues were identified, including the need to incorporate drone capabilities into disaster management plans, develop appropriate laws and regulations, establish public-private coordination mechanisms, address technological limitations due to advances in technology, and implement training programs specifically for drone operators. Collaboration among government agencies, private organizations, and industry associations in disaster response highlighted the importance of fostering partnerships and mobilizing collective expertise in disaster management. The study concludes by highlighting the important role that drones can play in enhancing emergency response efforts and mitigating the impact of future disasters.

The latter feature plays a crucial role in mitigating the identified risk. This article presents the new approach to risk assessment, which considers the first phase of introducing the service to the market and the specificity of UAV systems in warehouse operations. The fuzzy logic concept was used in the risk analysis model. The described risk assessment method was developed based on a literature review, historical data of a service company, observations of development team members, and the knowledge and experience of experts' teams. Thanks to this, the proposed approach considers the current knowledge in studies and practical experiences related to the implementation of drones in warehouse operations. The proposed methodology was verified on the example of the selected service for drones in the magazine inventory. The conducted risk analysis allowed us to identify ten scenarios of adverse events registered in the drone service in warehouse operations. Thanks to the proposed classification of events, priorities were assigned to activities requiring risk mitigation. The proposed method is universal. It can be implemented to analyze logistics services and support the decision-making process in the first service life phase.

Previous studies in canola phenology monitoring focused mainly on the flowering stage, using its apparent structure features and colors. Additional phenological stages have been largely overlooked. The objective of this study was to improve a shape-model method (SMM) for extracting winter canola phenological stages from time-series top-of-canopy reflectance images collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The transformation equation of the SMM was refined to account for the multi-peak features of the temporal dynamics of three vegetation indices (VIs) (NDVI, EVI, and CIred-edge). An experiment with various seeding scenarios was conducted, including four different seeding dates and three seeding densities. Three mathematical functions: asymmetric Gaussian function (AGF), Fourier function, and double logistic function, were employed to fit time -series vegetation indices to extract information about phenological stages. The refined SMM effectively estimated the phenological stages of canola, with a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.7 days for all phenological stages. The AGF function provided the best fitting performance, as it captured multi-ple peaks in the growth dynamics characteristics for all seeding date scenarios using four scaling param-eters. For the three selected VIs, CIred-edge achieved the greatest accuracy in estimating the phenological stage dates. This study demonstrates the high potential of the refined SMM for estimating winter canola phenology. (c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Phenological processes have been studied from landscape to global scales using Earth observing satellite data, and at local scale by in situ surveys of individual plants. Now, data acquired from multi-spectral sensors on drone platforms provide flexible opportunities for monitoring phenology from individual plants to small ecosystem scales efficiently, allowing community and species level information to be derived. We captured a time-series of drone-acquired normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with a multi-spectral sensor (Parrot Sequoia, (Parrot, France)) over a highly heterogeneous ecosystem in Cornwall, UK, during a period of spring green-up. We monitored NDVI trajectories at the individual crown and species' level. For deciduous crowns, we derived metrics representative of spring phenological stages: Start-of-spring (SOS), middle-of-spring green-up (MOG) and start-of-peak greenness (SOP) using a logistic function. While the exact timing of SOS, MOG and SOP appeared susceptible to understorey effects and saturation of the NDVI, relative timing of green-up for a subset of species was plausible in relation to phenological observations from an extended geographic region and in situ plant area index (PAI) measurements. In evergreen vegetation (Pinus spp.) subtle changes were also detected through the growing season. The impact of illumination differences was analysed for image pairs during leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. While significant, these effects were small (mean absolute NDVI deviation of up to 0.034 for leaf-off, 0.013 for leaf-on conditions), meaning that data captured under both constant direct and diffuse irradiance conditions can be used together and that cloudy conditions should not lead to data gaps. We conclude that the capability of drone-mounted multi-spectral instruments for spatio-temporal characterization of crown-level phenology shows great promise for improving the understanding of intra- and inter-species differences in strategy, and offers an efficient means of doing so over areas of a few hectares.

This study presents a scoping review of the current status and emerging opportunities in wetland UAV applications, with particular emphasis on ecosystem management goals and remaining research, technology, and data needs to even better support these goals in the future. Using 122 case studies from 29 countries, we discuss which wetland monitoring and management objectives are most served by this rapidly developing technology, and what workflows were employed to analyze these data. This review showcases many ways in which UAVs may help reduce or replace logistically demanding field surveys and can help improve the efficiency of UAV-based workflows to support longer-term monitoring in the face of wetland environmental challenges and management constraints.

{"TI": "The Mothership and Drone Routing Problem", "DE": "drone; vehicle routing; traveling salesman; ship; logistics", "AB": "The mothership and drone routing problem (MDRP) considers the routing of a two-vehicle tandem. The larger vehicle, which may be a ship or an airplane, is called the mothership; the smaller vehicle, which may be a small boat or unmanned aerial vehicle, is called the drone. We assume that there exists a set of target locations T. For each t in T, the drone must launch from the mothership, visit t, and then return to the mothership to refuel. The drone has a limited range of R time units. In the MDRP, we assume that both mothership and drone operate in the \"open seas\" (i.e., using the Euclidean metric). We also introduce the mothership and infinite-capacity drone routing problem (MDRP-IC), where a drone launches from the mothership and visits one or more targets consecutively before returning to the mothership. Our exact approach uses branch and bound, where each node of the branch-and-bound tree corresponds to a potential subsequence of the order of target visits. A lower bound at each node is given by solving a second-order cone program, which optimally chooses a launch point and landing point for each target in the subsequence. A set of heuristics that also uses a second-order cone program as an embedded procedure is presented. We show that our schemes are flexible to accommodate a variety of additional constraints and/or objective functions. Computational results and interesting variants of the MDRP and MDRP-IC are also presented. C1 [Poikonen, Stefan] Univ Colorado Denver, Business Sch, Denver, CO 80202 USA.

{"TI": "Path and Speed Optimization for Conflict-Free Pickup and Delivery Under Time Windows", "DE": "pickup and delivery; speed optimization; conflict-free routing", "AB": "This article introduces a variant of the conflict-free pickup and delivery problem with time windows in which speeds can be regulated. The problem arises in several areas of transportation and logistics including routing and scheduling of automated guided vehicles in port terminals and coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles in controlled airspace. A particular aspect of this problem is that at most one vehicle can traverse an arc of the transportation network at any time. The problem studied in this paper is to determine the vehicle paths and speeds on each arc of the path in such a way that no conflicts arise, the time windows are met, and the total energy consumption is minimized. A branch-and-bound algorithm is described in which a lower bound is obtained by solving a separable nonlinear problem in quadratic time. If the solution of the relaxation is not conflict free, a set of space-based and time-based branching constraints are generated to resolve the detected conflicts. Computational experiments show that, when compared with a state-of-the-art approach, the proposed method is able to generate a larger number of feasible solutions (42% on average) and reduce the computation time by an order of magnitude. Moreover, the approach results in an average energy savings of around 70%.

Content: Visual logistics help integrate and synthesize POCT and geospatial concepts. The resulting geospatial solutions presented here comprise: (1) small-world networks and regional topography; (2) space-time transformation, hubs, and asset mapping; (3) spatial and geospatial care paths (TM); (4) GIS-POCT; (5) isolation laboratories, diagnostics isolators, and mobile laboratories for highly infectious diseases; (6) alternate care facilities; (7) roaming POCT-airborne, ambulances, space, and wearables; (8) connected and wireless POCT outside hospitals; (9) unmanned aerial vehicles; (10) geospatial practice-demographic care unit resource scoring, geographic risk assessment, and national POCT policy and guidelines; (11) the hybrid laboratory; and (12) point-of-careology. Value: Small-world networks and their connectivity facilitate efficient and effective placement of POCT for optimal response, rescue, diagnosis, and treatment. Spatial care paths (TM) speed transport from primary encounters to referral centers bypassing topographic bottlenecks, process gaps, and time-consuming interruptions. Regional GISs position POCT close to where patients live to facilitate rapid triage, decrease therapeutic turnaround time, and conserve economic resources. Geospatial care paths (TM) encompass demographic and population access features. Timeliness creates value during acute illness, complex crises, and unexpected disasters. Isolation laboratories equipped with POCT help stop outbreaks and safely support critically ill patients with highly infectious diseases. POCT-enabled spatial grids can map sentinel cases and establish geographic limits of epidemics for ring vaccination. Impact: Geospatial solutions generate inherently optimal and logical placement of POCT conceptually, physically, and temporally as a means to improve crisis response and spatial resilience. If public health professionals, geospatial scientists, and POCT specialists join forces, new collaborative teamwork can create faster response and higher impact during disasters, complex crises, outbreaks, and epidemics, as well as more efficient primary, urgent, and emergency community care.

In this paper, we consider a variant of the combined truck-drone routing problem, which allows drones to serve multiple customers and provide both pickup and delivery services in each flight. The problem concerns the deployment and routing of a fleet of trucks, each equipped with a supporting drone, to serve all the pickup and delivery demands of a set of customers with minimal total cost. We explicitly model the energy consumption of drones by their travel distance, curb weight and the carrying weight of parcels, develop a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) with problem-customized inequalities, and show a sufficient condition for the benefit of the combined truck-drone mode over the truck-only mode. Considering the complexity of the MILP model, we propose a novel two-stage heuristic algorithm in which a maximum payload method is developed to construct the initial solutions, followed by an improved simulated annealing algorithm with problem-specific neighborhood operators and tailored acceleration strategies. Furthermore, two methods are developed to test the feasibility for both trucks and drones in each solution. The proposed algorithm outperforms two benchmark heuristics in our numerical experiments, which also demonstrate the considerable benefit of allowing multiple visits and both pickup and delivery operations in each drone flight.

With Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs; a.k.a. drones, UAS, or RPAS) starting to be used in healthcare systems outside the UK, there is interest in how they could be integrated into NHS operations to transport diagnostic specimens. Reflecting on a business-as-usual analysis of current NHS diagnostic specimen logistics across the Solent region (southern UK), this paper critically evaluates the practical reality of integrating UAV deliveries of this commodity, identifying the benefits and challenges that must be addressed to realise commercial services, including dangerous goods legislation, cargo stability, routing, and weather. In the analysis, 14 out of 79 surgeries could be realistically served by a 5m wingspan vertical take-off/landing (VTOL) UAV: seven directly, and seven via ground-based transfers. The results suggested that an average of 1,628 samples could be served by UAV each week, resulting in 42 flights/week with 10 taxi services to cover periods where weather limited flying. This equated to an approximate total service cost of 2,964 pound/week if regulations develop to relax UAV personnel constraints. The introduction of UAVs reduced the marginal external costs (greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, and air pollution) by 196 pound per week and cut travel times to UAV served sites by 72% (weather permitting). Tailpipe emissions (excl. taxis), vehicle-kilometres travelled, and van costs were reduced by 20%, 20%, and 23% (respectively), but the overall system cost increased by 56%. Whilst this increase is likely to make the introduction of UAV services financially challenging, the benefits in terms of emissions and journey time savings may offset some of the additional cost and warrant further investigation.

Logistic models, combined with multisource remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data, as well as the meteorological data over the past 20 years, were used to calculate sixteen phenological periods and biomass. The results show that (1) over the past two decades, snow drought has been based on the snow accumulation and has been occurring more frequently, wider-ranging and more severely; (2) snow drought has advanced the forest start of season (SOS)/end of season (EOS) by 6/5 days, respectively; (3) if the snowfall is greater than 80% of a normal year, the SOS/EOS of grass is postponed by 8/6 days; conversely, if it is less than 80%, the SOS/EOS are advanced by 7/5 days; and (4) biomass decreased approximately 0.61%, compared with an abundant snowfall year. Overall, this study is the first to explore how snow drought impacts the phenological period in a mid-high latitude area, and more attention should be paid to these unknown risks to the ecosystem.

This problem is formulated as the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, which minimises the drone's total distance by the optimal energy consumption to complete the scheduled services. For practical feasibility, this paper focuses on heuristic solutions that effectively solve the problem efficiently and near optimally. The approach facilitates the operations manager to decide on an appropriate drone travel capacity based on service distance and the size of on-demand customers in an urban hyper-local logistics environment.

Coupling structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry with RGB orthomosaic imagery allows researchers to characterize spatial-temporal geomorphic responses associated with differences in vegetation cover. Such approaches provide quantitative data on landscape morphodynamics and sediment erosion and deposition responses that allow scientists and land managers to assess the efficacy of dynamic restoration efforts and, in turn, make informed decisions for future restoration projects. Two different restored coastal foredune sites in Humboldt County, California were monitored between 2016-20 with UAS (quadcopter and fixed-wing), kite aerial photogrammetry (KAP), and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) platforms. We compared our KAP- and UAS-SfM elevation models to concurrently collected TLS bare earth models for five of our fifteen collections. The goal of this study was to inform on the potential of a multi-platform aerial approach for calculating geomorphic differences (i.e., topographic differencing), in order to quantify sediment erosion and deposition, and vegetation change over a coastal dune ecosystem. While UAS-SfM datasets were relatively well fit to their TLS counterparts (2.1-12.2% area of difference), the KAP-SfM surfaces exhibited higher deviations (23.6-27.6%) and suffered from systematic collection inconsistencies related to methods and susceptibility to external factors (e.g., the influence of wind speed and direction on variable altitude, image overlap, and coverage extent). Finally, we provide commentary on the logistical considerations regarding KAP and UAS data collection and the construction of uncertainty budgets for geomorphic change detection (GCD), while providing suggestions for standardizing methods for uncertainty budgeting. While we propose an approach that incorporates multiple levels of collection- and processing-based uncertainty, we also recognize that uncertainty is often project-specific and outline the development of potential standards for incorporating uncertainty budgets in SfM projects.

As technology continues to advance, drones have emerged as a notable innovation. Within the logistics field, there is growing interest in leveraging drones, particularly for handling small and medium-sized orders such as mobile phones. The appeal of drones lies in their economic and environmental advantages, attributed to their reduced energy consumption. These unmanned aerial vehicles are considered a valuable component of the ongoing technological revolution in transportation, with the potential to enhance the efficiency of last-mile deliveries. To explore their applicability, mixed vehicle-drone distribution models have surfaced as a promising alternative to traditional delivery methods. These models enable companies to minimize transportation costs by leveraging the strengths of both vehicles and drones. In this study, we present a solution to the vehicle routing model with multiple drones (VRPm-D). Our objective is to efficiently transport a specified quantity of products from a central depot to customers by devising optimal routes for both trucks and drones. The study focuses on employing a VRPm-D model to facilitate the transportation process, involving a predetermined fleet of vehicles and drones. The vehicles start and end their routes at a central depot. The primary goal is to minimize the time taken by trucks utilizing drones to cater to the needs of every customer effectively while considering the payload capacity and energy endurance constraints of the drones. To address these objectives, we propose a hybrid vehicle-drone routing problem formulated using the genetic clustering algorithm (HVDRP-GCA). This approach aims to optimize the routes and schedules for both vehicles and drones, taking into account the aforementioned constraints. Our results demonstrate that the processing time exponentially increases as the number of customers grows, particularly noticeable in routes with five or more customers. Importantly, the HVDRP-GCA model outperforms existing methods in the literature, providing favorable outcomes. The results highlight the dominance of our proposed model compared to previous approaches found in the literature.

{"TI": "An adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic for the vehicle routing problem with drones", "DE": "Delivery operations; Vehicle Routing Problems with Drones; UAVs; ALNS", "AB": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things, how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of interest.

The broad adoption of sUAS for remote sensing among these groups may be hampered by complex coding, expensive equipment, and time-consuming protocols. We used a consumer sUAS, semiautomated flight planning software, and graphical user interface GIS software to classify grassland vegetation with the aim of providing a user-friendly framework for managers and ecological researchers. We compared the overall accuracy from classifications using this sUAS imagery (89.22%) to classifications using freely available National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery (76.25%) to inform decisions about cost and accuracy. We also compared overall accuracy between manual classification (89.22%) and random forest classification (69.26%) to aid with similar decisions. Finally, we examined the impact of resolution and the addition of a canopy height model on classification accuracy, obtaining mixed results. Our findings can help new users make informed choices about imagery sources and methodologies, and our protocols can serve as a template for those groups wanting to perform similar vegetation classifications on grassland sites without the need for survey-grade equipment or coding. These should help more land managers and researchers obtain appropriate grassland vegetation classifications for their projects within their budgetary and logistical constraints.

This study aims to investigate the safety of pedestrians with a new perspective that focuses on consecutive conflicts occurring during pedestrian crossing. Based on about 9 h video data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle from six unsignalized crosswalks of a roundabout, consecutive conflicts were identified, and an integrated severity index that combines post encroachment time, jerk and yaw rate ratio was proposed to measure the severity of consecutive conflicts. Moreover, bivariate logistic models that account for and not account for the correlation between the pedestrianmotorized vehicle (P-MV) conflict and the pedestrian-non-motorized vehicle (P-NV) conflict of a consecutive conflict were developed, and speed-, count-, time to zebra-related factors and other factors of involved road users were considered in the models. A total of 899 consecutive conflicts were identified and on average one in six pedestrians encountered consecutive conflicts. The bivariate logistic modeling results show that the model accounting for the correlation significantly outperform its counterpart. A negative correlation is found between the severities of P-MV conflict and P-NV conflict, and the P-NV conflict is more likely to be the serious one. It is also found that speed of motorized vehicle and time to zebra for the first conflicting subject are the common factors that affect the severities of both P-NV conflicts and P-MV conflicts, while speed of pedestrian, speed of nonmotorized vehicle, number of motorized vehicles, number of non-motorized vehicles, group and direction of pedestrians have significant effects on the severity of either P-MV conflicts or P-NV conflicts.

However, research that investigates the coupling relationship between surface subsidence in mountainous regions and the occurrence of multiple surface hazards is scarce. Taking a coal mine in southwestern China as a case study, a detailed catalog of the surface hazards in the study area was created based on multi-temporal satellite imagery interpretation and Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology and the logistic subsidence prediction method, this study investigated the evolution of surface subsidence induced by underground mining activities and its impact on the triggering of multiple surface hazards. We found that the study area experienced various types of surface hazards, including subsidence, landslides, debris flows, sinkholes, and ground fissures, due to the effects of underground mining activities. The InSAR monitoring results showed that the maximum subsidence at the back edge of the slope terrace was 98.2 mm, with the most severe deformation occurring at the mid-slope of the mountain, where the maximum subsidence reached 139.8 mm. The surface subsidence process followed an S-shaped curve, comprising the stages of initial subsidence, accelerated subsidence, and residual subsidence. Additionally, the subsidence continued even after coal mining operations concluded. Predictions derived from the logistic model indicate that the duration of residual surface subsidence in the study area is approximately 1 to 2 years. This study aimed to provide a scientific foundation for elucidating the temporal and spatial variation patterns of subsidence induced by underground coal mining in mountainous regions and its impact on the formation of multiple surface hazards.

In this study, single-truck-multi-drone team logistics is considered. A mixed integer mathematical model is developed for the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, a single-truck-multi-drone problem by considering technical and energy issues. Two different objective functions are used in the model. The first objective function is to minimize the sum of arrival times. Minimizing the sum of arrival times for customers also minimizes the distance traveled by the vehicles and, accordingly, the cost. The second objective function is to minimize total tardiness. A dataset is generated to test the proposed model. Trade-offs between the results for the two objective functions are analyzed. The technical requirements of the drone, energy limits, and fleet size are considered in the proposed mathematical model. The effects of the flight ranges of the drones are investigated with respect to the energy constraint. It has been observed that changes in the number of customers and drones affect the results of the objective functions. The total arrival time and tardiness decreased with increasing number of drones. Thus, the number of deliveries by truck decreases for customers. In addition, the advantages of this hybrid approach have been proven by comparing situations where only land vehicles are used with truck-drone team logistics.

In this research work, we have developed a protocol for packet delivery called fuzzy adaptive routing protocol. This protocol uses factors like signal quality, signal to inference and noise ratio, hop count, and timestamp of the packet to decide on the broadcasting of route requests and reply messages. This protocol mainly contains two phases namely: controlled route request/reply broadcasting and optimal route selection for packet delivery. The performance of the proposed protocol is compared with recent techniques and the comparison depicts that the proposed protocol outperforms them and provides consistent service quality.

The present study analysed eight typical villages in Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, China, as examples. A combination of high-resolution remote sensing images and farm household survey data were used to explore the abandonment of terraces in mountainous areas. A multi-level logistic model was constructed to analyse the determinants of terrace abandonment based on three levels: plot, household and village. The results show that serious terrace abandonment occurred in the study area, with 33.78% of all terraces having been abandoned. The plot and household levels were important in influencing terrace abandonment by farmers. At the plot level, terrace abandonment is more likely to occur on small plots found at a long distance from residences with poor irrigation conditions and collapsed ridges. At the household level, households where the head had a relatively high level of education and households with relatively small agricultural labour forces and lower degrees of mechanisation had a higher probability of their terraces being abandoned. At the village level, a relatively high risk of terrace abandonment was found in villages relatively close to an administrative centre, with a low land transfer rate and a low rate of forest coverage. In conclusion, carrying out land consolidation projects and improving agricultural infrastructure in mountainous areas are important means to achieving the sustainable use of terraces.

The facilities serve as drone launching sites for distributing the resources. Each drone makes several one-to-one trips from the facility location to the demand points and back until the battery range is met. The planning period is short-term and therefore the recharging of drone batteries is not considered. This paper presents an integer linear programming formulation with the objective of maximizing coverage while explicitly incorporating the drone energy consumption and range constraints. The new formulation is called the Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones or simply MCFLPD. The MCFLPD is a complex problem and even for relatively small problem sizes a state of the art MIP solver may require unacceptably long running times to find feasible solutions. Computational efficiency of MCFLPD solutions is a key factor since conditions associated with customer demands or weather conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed) may change suddenly and require a fast global reoptimization. To better balance solution quality and running times novel greedy and three-stage heuristics (3SH) are developed. The 3SH is based on decomposition and local exchange principles and involves a facility location and allocation problem, multiple knapsack subproblems, and a final local random search stage. On average the 3SH solutions are within 5% of the best Gurobi solutions but at a small fraction of the running time. Multiple scenarios are run to highlight the importance of changes in drone battery capabilities on coverage.

The key resource to detect the Land Usages is aerial Images. The advancement in technology in form of satellites, drones, unmanned aerial vehicles do capture the tons of wide land cover images. Aerial images are used for various purposes alias getting an overview to put up the settlement by making construction, extracting mineral deposits, disaster mitigation planning, disaster recovery, and surveillance. Automated land usage identification with help of modern machine learning algorithms may be a great boon to mankind. Different feature extraction methods are being explored to represent aerial image content in the signature form, these features are mainly taken as a global or local content description of the image. Feature Level Fusion of both the global and the local content description features may give a more accurate capability for identification of land usage. The paper proposes feature level fusion of global features extracted using Thepade's Sorted Block Truncation Coding (Thepade SBTC) and local features extracted using Sauvola Thresholding for land usage identification. Consideration of more than one Machine Learning classifiers as an ensemble has proven better than individual Machine Learning classifiers. Thepade SBTC is explored in aerial image feature extraction with nine variations as TSBTC 2-ary, TSBTC 3-ary, TSBTC 4-ary, TSBTC 5-ary, TSBTC 6-ary, TSBTC 7-ary, TSBTC 8-ary, TSBTC 9-ary, and TSBTC 10-ary. The experimentation is done on UC Land Merced Dataset having 2100 images spread across 21 land usage types. Here the land usage identification accuracy, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and F Measure have shown better performance in TSBTC 10-ary global feature extraction method. Further, the TSBTC 10-ary global features are concatenated with Sauvola thresholding-based local features for feature level fusion, which show the performance improvement of the proposed land usage identification technique. Also, the ensembles of machine learning algorithms are deployed for performance assessment along with the individual nine machine learning algorithms for the proposed land usage identification technique. The majority voting-based ensemble of 'IB1+ Random Forest+ Simple Logistic+ SMO+ KStar' has resulted in better accuracy of land usage identification.

In particular, very few studies dealt so far with birds nesting in saltmarshes, a type of nesting habitats which poses several problems - such as logistical constraints due to the tidal cycle or damages to halophytic vegetation caused by trampling - when the traditional method, i.e., field surveys, is adopted. The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of drone-conducted monitoring of hatching success with the usual ground surveys on black-headed gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) breeding on marsh islands in the Lagoon of Venice (NE Italy). Fieldwork was performed throughout the breeding seasons of 2017-2019. Each year, one colony of black-headed gull was studied, and it was visited weekly for 4 weeks after laying to compare the relative effectiveness and safety for the monitored birds using both methods, i.e., ground vs. drone counts. No significant differences were found in the number of both eggs and hatchings (n = 543) per nest between the two methods. The average coefficient of agreement between the methods was high for all comparisons. Overall, 224.2 min were spent on censusing the three colonies by the traditional approach vs. 30.6 min by the drone method (- 86.4%). An additional 92.6 min were needed for the drone approach to process recorded videos. The mean time spent measuring the hatching success of the three colonies with a drone was far less, about 84.6% less, than that with the traditional approach. No apparent negative effects of drone flights on nesting pairs, clutches, or chicks were observed. Drone use allowed the effective, rapid, affordable, and safe measurement of black-headed gull breeding success in marsh islands.

Time-series RGB and multispectral data obtained with UAVs can be used for revealing changes of three-dimensional growth. We previously showed using a rice population with our regular cultivation protocol that canopy height (CH) parameters extracted from time-series RGB data are useful for predicting manually measured traits such as days to heading (DTH), culm length (CL), and aboveground dried weight (ADW). However, whether CH parameters are applicable to other rice populations and to different cultivation methods, and whether vegetation indices such as the chlorophyll index green (CIg) can function for phenotype prediction remain to be elucidated. Here we show that CH and CIg exhibit different patterns with different cultivation protocols, and each has its own character for the prediction of rice phenotypes. We analyzed CH and CIg time-series data with a modified logistic model and a double logistic model, respectively, to extract individual parameters for each. The CH parameters were useful for predicting DTH, CL, ADW and stem and leaf weight (SLW) in a newly developed rice population under both regular and delayed cultivation protocols. The CIg parameters were also effective for predicting DTH and SLW, and could also be used to predict panicle weight (PW). The predictive ability worsened when different cultivation protocols were used, but this deterioration was mitigated by a calibration procedure using data from parental cultivars.

The authors investigate competitive priorities and willingness to pay for key attributes of parcel delivery (mode, speed, method and time window), the role of contextual moderators such as parcel value and security and opportunities for logistics service providers in the growing e-commerce market. Design/methodology/approach A survey involving stated choice experiments has been conducted among 709 respondents in urban Australia. The authors estimated panel error component logit models, derived consumer priorities and deployed 576 Monte Carlo simulations to forecast potential delivery mode market shares. Findings The study results suggest that people prefer postie over drone delivery, all else equal, but that drone deliveries become competitive with large market shares if they live up to the premise that they can deliver faster and cheaper. Both drone and postie become less attractive relative to parcel lockers when there is no safe place to leave a parcel at a residence, highlighting the importance of situational context and infrastructure at the receiving end of last-mile delivery. The authors identified opportunities for chargeable add-on services, such as signature for postie and 2-h parcel deliveries for drones. Originality/value The authors offer timely and novel insights into consumers preferences towards aerial drone parcel deliveries compared to postie and lockers. Going beyond the extant engineering/operations research literature, the authors provide a starting point and add new dimensions/moderators for last-mile parcel delivery choice analysis and empirical evidence of market potential and competitive attributes of innovative versus traditional parcel delivery alternatives.

{"TI": "Detecting coffee leaf rust with UAV-based vegetation indices and decision tree machine learning models", "DE": "Multispectral imagery; Precision agriculture; Plant disease; Logistic model tree", "AB": "Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is one of the most devastating leaf diseases in coffee plantations. By knowing the symptoms, severity, and spatial distribution of CLR, farmers can improve disease management procedures and reduce losses associated with it. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-based images, in conjunction with machine learning (ML) techniques, helped solve multiple agriculture-related problems. In this sense, vegetation indices processed with ML algorithms are a promising strategy. It is still a challenge to map severity levels of CLR using remote sensing data and an ML approach. Here we propose a framework to detect CLR severity with only vegetation indices extracted from UAV imagery. For that, we based our approach on decision tree models, as they demonstrated important results in related works. We evaluated a coffee field with different infestation classes of CLR: class 1 (from 2% to 5% rust); class 2 (from 5% to 10% rust); class 3 (from 10% to 20% rust), and; class 4 (from 20% to 40% rust). We acquired data with a Sequoia camera, producing images with a spatial resolution of 10.6 cm, in four spectral bands: green (530-570 nm), red (640-680 nm), red-edge (730-740 nm), and nearinfrared (770-810 nm). A total of 63 vegetation indices was extracted from the images, and the following learners were evaluated in a cross-validation method with 10 folders: Logistic Model Tree (LMT); J48; ExtraTree; REPTree; Functional Trees (FT); Random Tree (RT), and; Random Forest (RF). The results indicated that the LMT method contributed the most to the accurate prediction of early and several infestation classes. For these classes, LMT returned F-measure values of 0.915 and 0.875, thus being a good indicator of early CLR (2 to 5% of rust) and later stages of CLR (20 to 40% of rust). We demonstrated a valid approach to model rust in coffee plants using only vegetation indices and ML algorithms, specifically for the disease's early and later stages. We concluded that the proposed framework allows inferring the predicted classes in remaining plants within the sampled area, thus helping the identification of potential CLR in non-sampled plants. We corroborate that the decision tree-based model may assist in precision agriculture practices, including mapping rust in coffee plantations, providing both an efficient non-invasive and spatially continuous monitoring of the disease.

Therefore, this study investigated the factors influencing consumers' intentions to use drone delivery. A theoretical model based on value-belief-norm theory was developed and tested with structural equation modeling based on data collected from 458 Korean consumers. The results suggest that the environmental protection, economic, and altruistic values of drone delivery positively impact consumers' perceptions of responsibility. In addition, the ascription of responsibility positively influences consumers' personal norms. Finally, personal norms are found to increase consumers' intentions to use drone delivery, and the impact is positively moderated by moral obligation. This study employs the extended value-belief-norm (VBN) framework and makes a valuable contribution to the existing body of literature. Furthermore, this study employs the VBN model to ascertain the ecological advantages associated with environmentally sustainable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

The use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for package deliveries offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility, efficiency, speed, safety, and even few environmental gains. However, the drones can come across various security hazards while communicating with ground installations on open channels including physical capture attack, privacy infringement, and so on. Thus, earnest endeavors are needed to fix those security challenges in applications related to drone communications. To address these problems, an efficient authenticated key agreement technique, drone access control scheme for last mile delivery (DAC-MD) is suggested for user-drone interactions in IoD environment that help the participating entities in developing a mutually agreed session key for securing subsequent communication interactions. The proposed scheme is proved using automated ProVerif tool as well as analyzed by using formal analysis based on RoR random oracle model. The comparative analysis against recently presented known studies reveals that our scheme not only carries comparable properties in terms of security and privacy, but also low computational and communication costs.

Vaccinating livestock is one of the most sustainable strategies to mitigate the impact of RVF on health and livelihoods. However, vaccine supply chain constraints severely limit the effectiveness of vaccination programs. In the human health sector, unmanned aerial vehicles, i.e., drones, are increasingly used to improve supply chains and last-mile vaccine delivery. We investigated perceptions of whether delivering RVF vaccines by drone in Rwanda might help to overcome logistical constraints in the vaccine supply chain. We conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the animal health sector and Zipline employees in Nyagatare District in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. We used content analysis to identify key themes. We found that stakeholders in the animal health sector and Zipline employees believe that drones could improve RVF vaccination in Nyagatare. The primary benefits study participants identified included decreased transportation time, improved cold chain maintenance, and cost savings.

This paper addresses a parcel delivery scheduling problem. In this problem, a truck loaded with drones and parcels leaves a distribution center and stops at some points on a fixed route. At each point, the drones take off and deliver parcels to customers. We define this problem as finding the assignment of customers to both the drones and their takeoff points. Then, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) for finding a near-optimal solution in a short time. In the proposed GA, a solution is represented using sets of customers assigned to the takeoff points, and a heuristic rule determines the assignment to the drones. The crossover operation enables offspring to inherit the customer sets. Experimental results show that the proposed GA can successfully find an optimal or a near-optimal solution faster than an integer programming solver for almost all instances. In addition, it significantly outperforms other GAs using a different crossover.

As a class of uncrewed aerial vehicles, drones have the potential to perform such assessment operations. We consider a drone arc routing problem in which road segments are evaluated selectively with the goal of maximizing the collected arc informative profits within a pre-defined time limit. The problem allows drones to travel between nodes without following the physical road network; i.e., drones can travel along the road network for assessment purposes, but they can also travel off the network to save travel time. This feature raises a novel challenge compared to the conven-tional arc routing problem, as multiple edges exist between two nodes, with different corresponding ben-efits. To address this challenge, a graph transformation technique is presented in which the multigraph-based arc routing problem is reduced to a node-based routing problem on a simple graph. Due to the significant uncertainties and limited information regarding the post-disaster transportation network, the problem is modeled as a new variant of a robust team orienteering problem with uncertain assessment time. Since the original robust formulation is intractable, we leverage path-based reformulation and ap-ply Lagrangian decomposition to the robust counterpart, which allows us to solve the robust subproblem efficiently through a series of deterministic auxiliary problems. We propose an efficient exact branch -and-price (B&P) framework to solve this problem exactly. In computational experiments, we examine the efficiency of our solution approach using various instances, including instances generated from real-world data as well as simulation, to demonstrate its practical applicability. The results show that compared with the traditional arc orienteering problem, our model achieves an approximately 30% improvement in the objective value.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Prior studies have investigated how an autonomous drone can be used in conjunction with a parcel delivery truck, but they all restricted the drones' launch/recovery sites to customer nodes visited by a truck. In practice, parcel carriers are considering the use of intermediate points (IPs), the sites found along the arcs connecting customer nodes, as drones' launch/recovery points. This means that the academic literature currently lags the industry practice. This article extends the previous works on truck-and-drone last-mile delivery by investigating the conditions under which the use of IPs is beneficial by using both theoretical and empirical approaches. Our results show that, although using IPs is an effective concept that can save the cost (time) of package deliveries by 2.189% on average, the cost saving realized by using IPs can vary notably across carriers depending on their network characteristics. Specifically, our results suggest that the benefit of using IPs becomes high when a network has the following characteristics: (1) low customer density (a small number of customers served per square mile), and (2) large number of time-sensitive packages (subject to time window constraints). Based on these findings, we provide normative implications on if, when, where, and to what extent IPs can be beneficial for the truck-and-drone joint operations in last-mile logistics.

Traditional post-construction monitoring of marshes involves in situ vegetation sampling and aerial imagery from fixed-wing occupied aircraft, but these methods can be logistically intensive and limited in spatial and temporal resolution. To address these limitations, we evaluated the use of Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS) in post-construction monitoring of the Lake Hermitage Marsh Creation Project in Plaquemine Parish, Louisiana, as a case study. Specifically, we used UAS-derived habitat classification maps to compare vegetation cover between created and reference (i.e., natural) marsh sites and conducted a power analysis to quantify the number of in situ plots needed to reliably characterize site-wide vegetation cover. Habitat classification accuracies of UAS-derived maps ranged from 77.9 to 84.5% with slightly lower accuracies at created relative to reference marsh sites due to their more heterogenous vegetation cover. UAS-derived maps discriminated between created and reference marsh sites based on vegetation community similarity, while in situ vegetation monitoring plots did not. Furthermore, our case study illustrates the ability of UAS-based habitat and vegetation classifications to complement, inform, and optimize plot-based, in situ vegetation sampling in future post-construction marsh monitoring plans.

This problem models the design of routes of drones or other vehicles that must visit a number of geographical elements to deliver some good or service and then move directly to the next using straight line displacements. We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second family of formulations is not time-dependent, instead it uses connectivity properties to ensure the proper definition of routes. We compare them on a testbed of instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone (SOC) representable and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational results reported in this paper show that our models are useful and our formulations can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems including neighborhoods that have already been studied in the literature. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and Variable Neighborhood Search. This algorithm performs very well since it provides promising feasible solutions and, in addition, it can be used to initialize the solvers with feasible solutions. (c) 2021 The Authors.

In order to make up for the cumbersome process of independent identification of rear-end collisions and lane change collisions on complex road sections, an appropriate identification method of traffic conflicts in the merge area of freeway work zone was explored, this study collected vehicle running tracking data from the merge areas of multiple work zones, using an unmanned aerial vehicle video technique. Based on an inter-frame difference method and the principle of a spatio-temporal context visual tracking algorithm, the vehicles were detected and tracked, and the coordinate data of the vehicles in continuous motion were parsed using MATLAB 2018b extension tools. Based on the behavior characteristics of vehicle conflict avoidance, a new identification method for evading severe traffic conflicts is proposed according to the initial velocity, acceleration, and accident rate of section traffic. Then, a statistical analysis was performed on the spatial distribution characteristics of the traffic conflicts in typical merge areas. The impacts of the road conditions in work zones, vehicle factors, and traffic flow factors on traffic conflicts were analyzed. A binomial logistic model was established to identify the main influencing factors. The results show that in the merge area of the freeway work zone, there are serious traffic conflicts between vehicles in the following two situations: (I) v ? [7,13.5] m/s and a ? [-3.96,-0.65] m/s(2); and (II) v ? [13.5,24.3] m/s, and a ? [-3.96,-1.57] m/s(2). The probabilities of serious traffic conflicts in the first and last 25 m of the merge area are greater than those in the other sections. The smaller the space between the upstream work zone and the merge area, the greater the probability of serious traffic conflicts between vehicles. When the average vehicle speed is relatively high, the probability of serious conflicts is the highest, i.e., by a multiple of 5.95 from the baseline. Moreover, the probability of serious conflicts between vehicles is higher for larger vehicles, i.e., 4.765 times that for small vehicles. The research results can serve as a reference for freeway management departments to improve the safety levels of merge areas during road work. For example, the probability of serious conflicts can be effectively reduced by setting up reasonable speed limit signs in the work zone, increasing the spacing between the work zone and merge area, and appropriately diverting large vehicles.

We investigated patterns of UAS use and associated outcomes across practices in Michigan within a quality improvement collaborative. Methods: The Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) Reducing Operative Complications from Kidney Stones (ROCKS) initiative maintains a web-based, prospective clinical registry of patients undergoing URS for urinary stone disease (USD). We analyzed all patients undergoing primary URS for renal and ureteral stones from June 2016 to July 2018 in the ROCKS registry. We determined rates of UAS usage across practices and associated outcomes, including 30-day emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalization, as well as stone-free rates. Using multivariate logistical regression, we determined the predictors of UAS use as well as outcomes, including stone-free rates, ED visits, and hospitalizations, associated with UAS use. Results: Of the 5316 URS procedures identified, UASs were used in 1969 (37.7%) cases. Stones were significantly larger and more likely to be located in the kidney in cases with UAS use. UAS use during URS varied greatly across practices (1.9%-96%, p < 0.05). After adjusting for clinical and surgical risk factors, UAS use significantly increased the odds of postoperative ED visits (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.93, p < 0.05) and hospitalization (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.22-2.56, p < 0.05) as well as decreased the odds of being stone free (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99, p < 0.05). Conclusions: In the current study, UAS use during URS for USD was not associated with an increased likelihood of being stone free; moreover, it increased the odds of a postoperative ED visit and or hospitalization. Our findings demonstrate that UAS use is not without risk and should be employed judiciously. C1 [Meier, Kristen; Jafri, S.

Although other fields of application received higher levels of support, a majority of the respondents were positive towards using drones for healthcare logistics. Transportation of medicine and blood samples between hospitals were the most accepted healthcare use cases. Support varies across age with the highest support found in the eldest age group. Also, themore citizens report to know about drones, the more they tend to support using them. The results suggest that policymakers and firms must be attentive towards the public opinion on drones and seek insights into what citizens regard as noble purposes of using drones.

Particularly in intricate three-dimensional (3D) environments, formulating the optimal flight path for drones poses a substantial challenge. Nonetheless, prevalent path-planning algorithms exhibit issues encompassing diminished accuracy and inadequate stability. To solve this problem, a hybrid improved symbiotic organisms search (ISOS) and sine-cosine particle swarm optimization (SCPSO) method for drone 3D path planning named HISOS-SCPSO is proposed. In the proposed method, chaotic logistic mapping is first used to improve the diversity of the initial population. Then, the difference strategy, the novel attenuation functions, and the population regeneration strategy are introduced to improve the performance of the algorithm. Finally, in order to ensure that the planned path is available for drone flight, a novel cost function is designed, and a cubic B-spline curve is employed to effectively refine and smoothen the flight path. To assess performance, the simulation is carried out in the mountainous and urban areas. An extensive body of research attests to the exceptional performance of our proposed HISOS-SCPSO.

We evaluated sUAS pilot states during the tactical response to the 2018 Kilauea Volcano Lower East Rift Zone event, using a 3-minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) and wrist worn heart rate sensor. The field data, collected over four days, indicated that the sUAS pilots did not recover to baseline vigilance and physiological levels. Some pilots stopped participating over time, owing to logistical constraints of performing the 3-minute PVT test. Additionally, all pilots refrained from rating their perceived workload levels. We summarize the utility of and challenges associated with collecting performance, physiological, and subjective measures of pilot fatigue during real disaster response. Background: Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), which provide remote presence at disasters, are teleoperated by emergency responders who experience elevated fatigue levels exacerbated by disrupted sleep/rest schedule as a mission unfolds. Purpose: We assessed fatigue states of responders who flew sUAS in both day and night missions while assisting with tactical response during the 2018 Kilauea Volcano Lower East Rift Zone event. Methods: We evaluated sUAS pilot states in a real-world disaster response using a 3-minute psychomotor vigilance test and a wrist worn heart rate sensor. Results: The field data, collected over four days, indicated that the sUAS pilots did not recover to baseline vigilance and physiological levels. Conclusions: This is the first study of this kind that evaluated operator states during human-sUAS interaction in a real-world disaster response. Findings here provide critical insights on the challenges and utility of different human factors and ergonomics methods, ranging from performance to physiological and subjective approaches, to capture operator states during high-risk disaster response.

This study is not limited to specific UAs but considers all of them in China as a whole, uses panel data of 285 cities in China from 2003 to 2020, introduces the spatial difference-in-differences Durbin model to verify the impacts of UA policies on economic development and their spatial effects, and further explores the intrinsic influence mech-anism. After various robustness tests, this study draws the following conclusions: (1) UA policies significantly promote the economic development of UAs and generate significant spatial spillover effects; (2) fixed assets and foreign direct investment significantly boosts the economic development of UAs, and the former has a significant spatial effect; the industrial structure negatively affects economic development; the digital economy is yet to take an essential role in economic development; and (3) mechanism analysis showed that UAs could promote regional economic development through green development, medical resources, and logistics. This study serves as a valuable reference for the overall development situation and internal development logic of UAs in China and proposes relevant policy suggestions.(c) 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Remote sensing platforms, such as unoccupied aircraft systems (UASs), present an alternative to traditional approaches that can quickly and inexpensively monitor coastal areas. Despite the advantages offered by remote sensing systems, challenges remain concerning the best practices to collect imagery to study these ecosystems. One such challenge is the range of spatial resolutions for imagery that is best suited for intertidal habitat monitoring. Very fine imagery requires more collection and processing times. However, coarser imagery may not capture the fine-scale patterns necessary to understand relevant ecological processes. This study took UAS imagery captured along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Florida, USA, and resampled the derived orthomosaic and digital surface model to resolutions ranging from 3 to 31 cm, which correspond to the spatial resolutions achievable by other means (e.g., aerial photography and certain commercial satellites). A geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) workflow was then applied to datasets at each resolution to classify mudflats, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and water. The GEOBIA process was conducted within R, making the workflow open-source. Classification accuracies were largely consistent across the resolutions, with overall accuracies ranging from 78% to 82%. The results indicate that for habitat mapping applications, very fine resolutions may not provide information that increases the discriminative power of the classification algorithm. Multiscale classifications were also conducted and produced higher accuracies than single-scale workflows, as well as a measure of uncertainty between classifications.

{"TI": "A methodological approach to assess canopy NDVI-based tomato dynamics under irrigation treatments", "DE": "Deficit irrigation; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Multispectral sensor; Vegetation index; Nonlinear mixed model", "AB": "A tomato field experiment under deficit irrigation treatments was established to assess the feasibility of non-linear mixed models to predict the change in the canopy Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) along the growing season. The irrigation doses were 50, 70, 85, and 100 % of the actual evapotranspiration (ETc). The experiment was performed in the Peruvian Arid Coastal Region (13.10 S, 76.37 W). On-ground destructive plant measurements (7 times) allowed to obtain the leaf area index (LAI) and the canopy equivalent water thickness (EWTcanopy) to validate the experiment. Similarly, volumetric soil moisture was monitored at three hours interval using time-domain reflectometry. High-resolution multispectral imagery was acquired along the growing season (10 times) using an unmanned aerial vehicle. NDVI at plant level was obtained based on oversegmented imagery. The canopy NDVI growth curves were obtained in relation to the irrigation treatments and growing degree days (GDD) using a nonlinear mixed model. Deficit irrigation doses (50, 70 and 85 % ETc) induced lower biomass accumulation and greatly affected LAI and EWTcanopy, attaining lower values (p < 0.05) than the control (100 % ETc). In spite of reaching higher LAI and EWTcanopy values, 70 % ETc was not significantly different from 50 % ETc (p < 0.05) showing the difficulty to accurately discriminate treatments with high deficit irrigation; 85 % ETc produced important differences on EWTcanopy and LAI compared to the other deficit irrigation treatments (p < 0.05) due to a higher leaf area expansion. Deficit irrigation doses led to less vigorous plants resulting in lower NDVI compared to the control. Notwithstanding 50 % ETc obtained lower NDVI values than 70 % ETc, differences were not significant. Volumetric soil moisture was consistent with the irrigation treatments, resulting in a decreased trend with decreasing water application along the growing season. A three-parameter logistic mixed model was found to be well-suited to fit the tomato canopy NDVI growth curves in function of the irrigation treatments (i.e. fixed effects) considering the plant-specific variability (i.e. random effects). At maturity stage, significant differences of the deficit irrigation treatments from the control were obtained (p < 0.05) when cumulative effect of the treatments was well-defined and NDVI reached asymptotic behavior. During the vegetative stage, the inflection point marked the fastest NDVI growth rate for the 100 % ETc treatment whereas the lowest for the 50 % ETc (p < 0.05). The diagnosis plots and the low root mean squared error of the residuals indicated the suitability of using the three-parameter logistic growth curve estimated as a nonlinear mixed model to predict NDVI.

Here, we propose a procedure of using uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) to obtain successive phenotype data for growth analysis. The objectives of this study were to obtain high-temporal UAS-based phenotype data for growth analysis and investigate the correlation between the UAS-based phenotype and biomass yield. Seven different energy cane genotypes were grown in a random complete block design with four replications. Twenty-six UAS flight missions were flown throughout the growing season, and canopy cover (CC) and canopy height (CH) measurements were extracted. A five-parameter logistic (5PL) function was fitted through these temporal measurements of CC and CH. The first- and second-order derivatives of this function were calculated to obtain several growth parameters, which were then used to assess the growth of different genotypes with respect to weed competitiveness and biomass yield traits. The results show that CC and CH growth rates significantly differed among genotypes. TH16-16 was outstanding for its ground cover growth; therefore, it was identified as a weed-competitive genotype. Furthermore, TH16-22 had a higher CH maximum growth rate per day, yielding a higher biomass compared to other genotypes. The CH-based multi-temporal data as well as the growth parameters had a better relationship with biomass yield. This study highlights the application of UAS-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), along with growth analysis, for assisting plant breeders in decision-making.

The total laboratory activity was analyzed per min for the complete year of 2018. The time from the clinical ordering of tests to the loading of the drone, drone transport time, and analysis time after the sample arrived at the analyzing laboratory were assessed using the lead time of emergency analyses of C-reactive protein, troponin, and the international normalized ratio. The activity had characteristic diurnal patterns, with the most intensive traffic between 8 and 12 a.m. on weekdays and there being considerably less traffic for the rest of the day, at night and on weekends. Drone schedules with departures 15-60 min apart were simulated. A maximum of 15 min between flights was required to meet the emergency demand for the analyses being completed within 60 min. The required drone weight capacity was below 3.5 kg at all times. In multiple simulations, the drone times were appropriate, whereas variations in the clinic- and laboratory-related time intervals caused violations of the allowed time 50% of the time. Drone transport with regular schedules may potentially improve the transport time compared with traditional ground transport and allow the merging of large laboratories, even when the demand for emergency analyses restricts the maximum transport time. Comprehensive economic evaluations and robust drone technology are needed before such solutions can be ready for implementation.

Despite their usefulness, direct displacement measurements are typically not collected due to the cumbersome logistical issues of sensor placement and maintenance and the impracticality of instrumenting contact-based sensors across all significant structures. In this context, this study proposes a novel dual stereovision technique to measure the dynamic displacement of structures using a portable, noncontact measurement system that involves an uncrewed aerial system (UAS) and four optical cameras. One pair of cameras tracks the three-component (x, y, and z) motion of a region of interest (ROI) on a structure with respect to the UAS system, and the other pair of cameras measure the six degrees of freedom motion (6-DOF) (both rotational and translational motion) of the UAS system by tracking a stationary reference. The motion of the UAS is then compensated for to recover the true dynamic displacement of the ROI. The proposed dual stereovision technique realizes simultaneous measurement of all three components of displacements of the structure and 6-DOF of UAS motion through a mathematically elegant process. The unique dual stereovision technique allows flexibility in choosing a global reference coordinate system, greatly enhancing the feasibility of applying the new technology in various field environments. This new technique has overcome the major challenge of significant UAS motions in full-scale applications. Furthermore, this technique relies on natural features and eliminates the requirement of artificial targets on the structure, permitting applications to difficult-to-access structures.

{"TI": "Drone scheduling model for delivering small parcels to remote islands considering wind direction and speed", "DE": "Drone; Scheduling; Parcel delivery; Remote Islands; Robust optimization; Case study", "AB": "The logistics infrastructure in urban areas has been gradually strengthened; however, delivery demand on small islands or in mountainous regions might not be met in a timely manner because of intrinsic geographical conditions. However, with the rapid development of drone-related technologies (i.e., small unmanned aerial vehicles), drone-based parcel delivery is considered a viable alternative for delivery to such areas. In this paper, we propose a drone scheduling model to maximize the minimum delivery amount to the target islands. In particular, a robust optimization is adopted to consider the uncertainties of wind direction and speed. To capture the impact of wind on the performance of the proposed scheduling models, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. Moreover, we performed validation experiments with real weather data to determine the feasibility of the proposed models and cross-check the sensitivity analysis results. The results indicate that the proposed robust optimization-based approach achieves better performance than the deterministic model under strengthening wind conditions. Stronger wind corresponds to a better performance of the proposed model. Also, a cost analysis was conducted to support the usage of drones for parcel delivery to remote islands, and it showed that the longer the drone-based delivery is operated, the more operation costs can be saved in comparison with the current practice.

Stimulated by recent technological progress and increasing regulatory clarity especially larger cities are anticipated to use drones for parcel and passenger transport hoping to relieve congested inner city traffic. Despite it is first and foremost the urban population that would be affected by accessing lower airspace, only few studies addressed the public perception of using transport drones. Aiming to fill the gap of attitudinal and acceptance research in the context of drones, the article embraces the subject by presenting qualitative results of a series of five focus groups conducted in three German cities. The analysis of discussions shows that participants were largely ambivalent towards the use of drones, putting special emphasis on a variety of object-related factors (safety and security, sustainability, usefulness), subject-related factors (general perception of technology) and also context-related factors (potential societal implications of drone technology). Framed by a discussion of identified acceptance factors in the context of the present scientific debate and assessing drones' potential social implications the article provides a profound qualitative exploration into one of the most disruptive and controversial future technologies that may transform both the transport world and urban societies.

We tried to answer this research question through a case study for Johnsons and Hurd glaciers, Livingston Island, using a fixed-wing RPAS, in particular, a Trimble UX5 UAV with electric pusher propeller by brushless 700 W motor, chosen for its ability to fly long distances and reach inaccessible areas. We also evaluated the accuracy of the point clouds and digital surface models (DSM) generated by aerial photogrammetry in our case study. The results were validated against ground control points taken by differential GNSS techniques, showing an accuracy of 0.16 +/- 0.12 m in the vertical coordinate. Various hypotheses were proposed and flight-tested, based on variables affecting the flight operation and the data collection, namely, gusty winds, low temperatures, battery life, camera configuration, and snow reflectivity. We aim to provide some practical guidelines that can help other researchers using fixed-wing drones under climatic conditions similar to those of the South Shetland Islands. Performance of the drone under harsh weather conditions, the logistical considerations, and the amount of snow at the time of data collection are factors driving the necessary modifications from those of conventional flight operations. We make suggestions concerning wind speed and temperature limitations, and avoidance of sudden fog banks, aimed to improve the planning of flight operations. Finally, we make some suggestions for further research. C1 [Bello, Ana Belen; Alvarez, Marina] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETS Ingn Informat, Madrid 28040, Spain.

However, monitoring wildlife populations poses economic and logistic challenges especially in complex and remote habitats. Declines in wildlife populations can remain undetected for years unless effective monitoring techniques are developed, guiding appropriate management actions. We developed an automated survey workflow using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to quantify the number and size of individual animals, using the well-studied Scandinavian harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) as a model species. We compared ground-based counts using telescopes with manual flights, using a zoom photo/video, and pre-programmed flights producing orthomosaic photo maps. We used machine learning to identify and count both pups and older seals and we present a new method for measuring body size automatically. We evaluate the population's reproductive success using drone data, historical counts and predictions from a Leslie matrix population model. The most accurate and time-efficient results were achieved by performing pre-programmed flights where individual seals are identified by machine learning and their body sizes are measured automatically. The accuracy of the machine learning detector was 95-97% and the classification error was 4.6 +/- 2.9 for pups and 3.1 +/- 2.1 for older seals during good light conditions. There was a clear distinction between the body sizes of pups and older seals during breeding time. We estimated 320 pups in the breeding season 2021 with the drone, which is well beyond the expected number, based on historical data on pup production. The new high quality data from the drone survey confirms earlier indications of a deteriorating reproductive rate in this important harbour seal colony. We show that aerial drones and machine learning are powerful tools for monitoring wildlife in inaccessible areas which can be used to assess annual recruitment and seasonal variations in body condition.

The objectives of this study were to identify the initial day of anthesis (IA(DAS)) of soybean varieties based on remote sensing multispectral time-series images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and analyze the differences in the initial anthesis of the same soybean varieties between two different climatic regions, Shijiazhuang (SJZ) and Xuzhou (XZ). First, the temporal dynamics of several key crop growth indicators and spectral indices were analyzed to find an effective indicator that favors the identification of IA(DAS), including leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (AGB), canopy height (CH), normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI), red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), green normalized-difference vegetation index (GNDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and normalized-difference red-edge index (NDRE). Next, this study compared several functions, like the symmetric gauss function (SGF), asymmetric gauss function (AGF), double logistic function (DLF), and fourier function (FF), for time-series curve fitting, and then estimated the IA(DAS) of soybean varieties with the first-order derivative maximal feature (FDmax) of the CIred edge phenology curves. The relative thresholds of the CIred edge curves were also used to estimate IA(DAS), in two ways: a single threshold for all of the soybean varieties, and three different relative thresholds for early, middle, and late anthesis varieties, respectively. Finally, this study presented the variations in the IA(DAS) of the same soybean varieties between two different climatic regions and discussed the probable causal factors. The results showed that CIred edge was more suitable for soybean IA(DAS) identification compared with the other investigated indicators because it had no saturation during the whole crop lifespan. Compared with DLF, AGF and FF, SGF provided a better fitting of the CIred edge time-series curves without overfitting problems, although the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were not the best. The FDmax of the SGF-fitted CIred edge curve (SGF_CIred edge) provided good estimates of the IA(DAS), with an RMSE and mean average error (MAE) of 3.79 days and 3.00 days, respectively. The SGF-fitted_CIred edge curve can be used to group the soybean varieties into early, middle and late groups. Additionally, the accuracy of the IA(DAS) was improved (RMSE = 3.69 days and MAE = 3.09 days) by using three different relative thresholds (i.e., RT50, RT55, RT60) for the three flowering groups compared to when using a single threshold (RT50). In addition, it was found that the IA(DAS) of the same soybean varieties varied greatly when planted in two different climatic regions due to the genotype-environment interactions. Overall, this study demonstrated that the IA(DAS) of soybean varieties can be identified efficiently and accurately based on UAV remote sensing multispectral time-series data.

Recognizing the potential role of drones in mitigating these challenges, we aimed to investigate the impact of medical drone transport on the stability of mAbs. Compromised stability could lead to aggregation and immunogenicity, thereby jeopardizing the efficacy and safety of mAbs. We studied the transportation of vials as well as ready-to-administer infusion bags with blinatumomab, tocilizumab, and daratumumab. The methodology involved the measurement of both temperature and mechanical shock during drone transport. Moreover, the analytical techniques High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Light Obscuration (LO), Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI), and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) were employed to comprehensively assess the presence of aggregates and particle formation. The key findings revealed no significant differences between car and drone transport, indicating that the stability of mAbs in both vials and infusion bags was adequately maintained during drone transport. This suggests that medical drones are a viable and reliable means for the inter-hospital transport of mAbs, paving the way for more efficient and predictable logistics in healthcare delivery.

Uplink (UL), downlink (DL), and ping parameters were chosen as the secondary ones, as they indicate the quality of the link depending on primary parameters. The analysis is based on experimental measurements performed using a Latvian mobile operator's \"LMT\" JSC infrastructure in a real-life scenario. To evaluate the altitude impact on the selected network parameters, the measurements were performed using a drone as transport for the following altitude values: 40, 60, 90, and 110 m. Network parameter measurements were implemented in automatic mode, allowing switching between LTE4-LTE2 standards, providing the opportunity for more complex analysis. Based on the analysis made, the recommendations for the future mobile networks employed in controlled drone flights should correspond to the following KPI and their values: -100 dBm for RSRP, -16 dB for RSRQ, -5 dB for SINR, 4096 kbps for downlink, 4096 kbps for uplink, and 50 ms for ping.

{"TI": "Truck-drone team logistics: A heuristic approach to multi-drop route planning", "DE": "Drones; Delivery; Tandem truck-drone; Optimization; Heuristic", "AB": "Recently there have been significant developments and applications in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In a few years, these applications will be fully integrated into our lives. The practical application and use of UAVs presents several problems that are of a different nature to the specific technology of the components involved. Among them, the most relevant problem deriving from the use of UAVs in logistics distribution tasks is the so-called \"last mile\" delivery. In the present work, we focus on the resolution of the truck-drone team logistics problem. The problems of tandem routing have a complex structure and have only been partially addressed in the scientific literature. The use of UAVs raises a series of restrictions and considerations that did not appear previously in routing problems; most notably, aspects such as the limited power-life of batteries used by the UAVs and the determination of rendezvous points where they are replaced by fully-charged new batteries. These difficulties have until now limited the mathematical formulation of truck-drone routing problems and their resolution to mainly small-size cases. To overcome these limitations we propose an iterated greedy heuristic based on the iterative process of destruction and reconstruction of solutions. This process is orchestrated by a global optimization scheme using a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. We test our approach in a large set of instances of different sizes taken from literature. The obtained results are quite promising, even for large-size scenarios.

AIRDROP is a visionary platform conceived to offer a cohesive disaster management approach spanning from preparedness to recovery of a wide range of natural and human-made disasters. AIRDROP aims to be a scalable, modular and flexible solution, employing an array of drones of different sizes and payload capabilities, able to provide different HL services to first responders and operational decision-makers. This study aims to elicit, specify and validate the requirements for AIRDROP to ensure their applicability across a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios and the entire disaster management continuum. This research utilized a thorough literature review and expert consultations to systematically elicit and specify the AIRDROP requirements, ensuring they were grounded in both academic foundations and practical industry standards. The validation process involved a questionnaire survey administered to 26 participants from various professional backgrounds. The requirements were prioritized using the MoSCoW methodology, and significant differences among participant groups were identified through the Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U tests. Furthermore, two critical requirements emerged from open-ended responses. As a result, 276 out of the initially defined 335 requirements in total advanced to the design phase. It is worth noting that the dynamic nature of requirements in HL necessitates ongoing assessment and adaptation to keep AIRDROP at the forefront and aligned with evolving needs.

Despite this significant information need, the measurement of forest carbon using field methods remains laborious, expensive and logistically complex.Recent FindingsLaser scanning technologies mounted on terrestrial, unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, aircraft or satellites have revolutionised the estimation of forest carbon at a variety of spatial and temporal scales with each providing detailed and often unique information about the distribution of biomass and carbon within a stand. In this review, we examined the use of laser scanning technologies for this purpose. SummaryTo do so we focus on the recently published (within 10 years) peer reviewed literature and consider studies across four information needs, individual tree, stand, regional / national, and global scales. We consider the type of laser scanning data that is typically acquired, data processing pipelines and the products that are produced. After reviewing these studies, we conclude with a discussion of remaining issues associated with the mapping of forest carbon using laser scanning technologies. We also highlight a number of future research directions to further expand the use of this technology for forest carbon mapping globally. C1 [Coops, Nicholas C.; Irwin, Liam A.

The current status of pesticide application techniques for small-scale rice farmers in Red River Delta, Vietnam aims to be clarified to control serious rice pest insects, such as Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) ( Hemiptera: Delphacidae), which live on the bottom of rice plants. Interviews with farmers revealed their preferences and practices towards pesticide application. The farmers' application technique was evaluated by investigating the droplet deposition level at different heights of rice plants (bottom, middle, and top) and the distance from the spray walking path (near, middle, and far) in a rice paddy field using water-sensitive paper (WSP). Droplet deposition on WSPs was categorized into eight ranks. Ordered logistic model analysis revealed that the droplet did not reach to the bottom of plant, while no significant differences were found among the distances from the walking path. The droplet deposition rank and the mortality of N. lugens were positively correlated. The low efficiency of the pesticide applied by farmers to control N. lugens could be one of the factors that contribute to the insecticide-resistance development of N. lugens in Vietnam.

Current last-mile operations are inefficient, and economic competitiveness is influenced by limited time windows for freight delivery in complex urban environments. Technological innovations and CL initiatives have enabled the development of novel, complex, and sustainable solutions. Unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) have gained attention in literature, and this paper aims to evaluate and find the most suitable drone-based CL concept for Kochi city in Kerala, India. Considering the city's geography, 11 feasible drone-based CL concepts are identified and evaluated by applying F-CoCoSo (Fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution) method. The fuzzy Sugeno-Weber operator is used to aggregate the expert opinions. The results imply that the best ranked alternatives are A3 (Barges acting as mobile depots for drone launching for delivery zones near to inland waterways and MCCs for services outside delivery zones), and A9 (Barges acting as mobile depots, transporting goods to generator groups, with drones executing final delivery phases). This article provides insights into the potential of drone applications in CL concepts, offering guidance for future policymakers and planners in defining development directions in urban areas. It also inspires the use of emerging technologies and known CL initiatives in defining new CL concepts. The approach also helps decision-makers address CL problems by considering stakeholder interests and incorporating their goals into a comprehensive decision-making framework, ensuring effective CL solutions.

Lately, the development of both electronic and quick commerce has driven carriers and courier operators to identify more effective methods for express parcel delivery. To this end, the development of efficient distribution networks that aim in increasing customer experience while maintaining low operating costs is significant importance both for researchers as well as for practitioners. This article presents a dataset for the Van Drone Routing Problem with Multiple Delivery Points and Cooperation (VDRPMDPC). The latter examines a van-drone team from an operational viewpoint, where a van moves along a road network while the drone egress and ingress from a van to a nearby delivery location and then travels back to the van. This problem has been created with the aim of assessing the design of more sustainable and costeffective delivery routes in urban and semi urban environments via the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). For the development of this dataset real geographical positions have been used located at two different areas of Athens, Greece.

To address this practical limitation, we developed a modular vector that contains the regulatory elements from all three binary systems, enabling Gal4-, LexA- or QF-dependent expression of transgenes. Our methods also incorporate DNA elements that facilitate independent site-specific recombination and elimination of regulatory UAS, LexAop or QUAS modules with spatial and temporal control, thus offering unprecedented possibilities and logistical advantages for in vivo genetic modulation and efficient interconversion of overexpression transgenic fly lines.

In this paper, a high-precision finite element model of small rotor logistics UAVs on the market was built in LS-DYNA. The process to model the connection structure between a range of parts of a UAV was elucidated in detail. The bolt, damping spring and rivet & thread were respectively simulated with \"NRB + beam\", \"NRB + discrete\" and \"spot weld\". By a series of static and dynamic material tests, the constitutive parameters of main materials of UAV structure were determined. Besides, a reasonable explicit time step was set by regulating the mass scaling of local elements. To verify whether the finite element model of UAV is accurate, UAV underwent a developed full-scale crash test. As revealed from the experimentally achieved results, the trend of impact load over time in collision simulation significantly complied with the experimentally achieved results, and the discrepancy between the maximum impact load peak and the experimentally achieved results only took up 6.54%. Moreover, the vital damaged parts, damaging process and failure mode of the UAV structure in the crash test were accurately characterized in the collision simulation. Thus, the UAV modeling and collision simulation was verified to exhibit feasibility. Lastly, with the verified UAV high precision model, the impacting process, possible damaged parts and failure modes of UAV at the variety of angles and speeds were assessed. Accordingly, the proposed high-precision modeling and collision simulation of small rotor UAV is capable of saving the physical and time resources of UAV structural strength experiments, as well as effectively assessing the structural safety and improving the design of small rotor UAVs.

{"TI": "Daytime polysomnography to perform titration for upper airway stimulation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea", "DE": "Upper airway stimulation; Daytime polysomnography; Device titration; Obstructive sleep apnea; Sleep medicine", "AB": "Purpose Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is an innovative treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). UAS titrations are performed 3 months after activation of the device to optimize its effectiveness. In general, these titrations are performed during an in-laboratory overnight polysomnography (PSG). However, overnight titrations are expensive and can be logistically challenging because they are labor-intensive which causes shortage of sleep technicians available for night shifts. In addition, recently, overnight PSGs were postponed and canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a daytime PSG to perform titration of UAS therapy as an alternative for a conventional overnight PSG. Methods We performed a prospective single-center observational cohort study. Patients were included when planned for UAS titration; this was approximately 6 months after UAS activation. Data on sleep architecture, patient experience, and respiratory outcomes were collected to evaluate the feasibility. An overnight follow-up PSG 12 months after implantation was used to compare sleep architecture and therapy response. Results Of 23 patients, four were excluded from analysis because of technical issues during PSG. Even though patients slept significantly shorter during the daytime PSG, this was enough time to complete the titration successfully with 30-min sleep in final therapeutic settings in 84% of the patients. Patients (94%) had a positive experience with the daytime titration. Respiratory outcomes were significantly reduced during titration and were maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Daytime titrations are a valuable alternative for conventional overnight titrations. Our findings suggest the implementation of daytime titrations as standard of care. This will contribute to easier logistics and better work circumstances for sleep technicians without jeopardizing titration quality. C1 [Bosschieter, Pien F.

First, considering the costs of UAV trajectory distribution, impact, threat, and other costs, a forward and reverse scheduling model with time windows for joint multi-distribution center material distribution and waste anti-epidemic materials collection vehicle-UAV is established. Meanwhile, a two-stage metaheuristic algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the first stage of the solution algorithm, we design the multi-strategy guided adaptive differential evolution (MSGA-DE) to plan the multi-UAV cooperative distribution situation in a 3D environment. In the second stage, an improved beluga whale optimization based on hybrid neighborhood search (HNS-IBWO) is combined to solve the vehicle-UAV scheduling and distribution problem. Furthermore, comparing with various cross-validation algorithms, it validates the superiority of MSGA-DE in solving UAV trajectory issues and the convergence speed and accuracy of HNS-IBWO for high-latitude complex optimizations. Finally, a simulation in a closed Shanghai community validates the proposed model. Results demonstrate its effectiveness, especially in terms of convergence, multi-objective search, and global search capabilities when compared to existing algorithms. This offers an efficient solution for vehicle-UAV scheduling in unforeseen epidemic-related closures.
